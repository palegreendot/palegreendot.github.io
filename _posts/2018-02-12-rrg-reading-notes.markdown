## [On the Seelie and Unseelie Courts](https://lexicaldoll.wordpress.com/2017/08/09/on-the-seelie-and-unseelie-courts/)
- There appear to be two kinds of social reality
- Unseelie - type that fixates on dark and manipulative aspects
    - Brazenness
    - Manipulation
    - "Acceptance of the cesspool of human communication"
- Seelie - type that fixates on light, conversational, flow aspects
    - Niceness
    - Community
    - Civilization
    - Willfully blind to the concept that passive moves have consequences
- Neither side contains good people but both sides have good intentions
- When Seelie and Unseelie meet, there is an implicit unacknowledged struggle
- There is a sensation of tongue-tiedness and a change in conversational flow
- Discussion question
    - Do you feel that you're more Seelie or Unseelie?

## [On Dangerous Technology](https://lexicaldoll.wordpress.com/2017/07/09/on-dangerous-technology/)
- "Dangerous technologies"
    - Anger others
    - Can provoke crises
- Mindhacking and trying weird things can be dangerous technologies
    - Example: "sparkliness"
        - Mix of hypomania and introspection
        - Can be directed outwards
        - Combined with an understanding of narrative and social reality
        - Starts to feel like a real thing if other people start validating the intuitions fostered by this practice
        - Drawback: hypomania is pushed to full-blown mania and you lose touch with reality
    - Dangerous technologies are generally defined by high-variance interventions
        - Meditation can be a dangerous technology if you push it far enough
        - Some nootropics are dangerous technologies
    - The power of belief is an up-and-coming dangerous technology
        - Belief in bulletproofing (i.e. bulletproofing charms that encourage bravery and group cooperation)
        - Conviction charisma among startup founders (i.e. "reality distortion field")
- Not all mindhacks are dangerous
    - Double cruxing
    - Developing charisma through practice and ordinary socialization
    - Various techniques for overcoming bias
    - Most traditional rationalist techniques are "safe" whereas "dangerous technologies" are more in the "post-rationalist" canon
- Dangerous technologies are appealing because they create outcomes quickly without a lot of effort
- The problem is that the outcome can be good or bad
- Dangerous technologies are unproven, and using them too blatantly tends to alienate the more grounded people around you
- Discussion questions
    - How does one approach a risk benefit analysis, when one of the risks is going insane?
    - Are non-dangerous technologies powerful/proven enough to be worth the additional effort?

## [On The Tangent Stack](https://lexicaldoll.wordpress.com/2017/09/17/on-the-tangent-stack/)
- How do you keep a conversation going and make it seem fun?
- Strive to generate response that give you hooks to follow up on
- These hooks are often little tangents in the other person's story
- Instead of bringing up the tangent right away, remember it, and then ask a question about it when the conversation lulls
- Example story
    - Friend gets on the wrong train and falls asleep
    - Ends up in the wrong state entirely
    - Gets off lost and despairing and goes to a Waffle House
    - Approached by a strange man in a trenchcoat who offers tickets to the right destination
    - Tickets are legitimate and friend ends up at their destination only a day late
- Example tangents
    - How did they learn to sleep that deeply on the train
    - What part of the wrong state did they end up in
    - How did they find a Waffle House so fast
    - How did the man in the trenchcoat make them feel
    - What was their actual destination like
- All of these tangents can generate further tangents, which can be used to keep the conversation going longer
- Simple concept that plays to the strengths of people with strong working memory
- Less helpful when telling stories, as opposed to asking questions
- Doesn't give you a way to wind down a conversation
- Discussion questions
    - How much of a tangent can you maintain?
    - What does it feel like to have a tangent stack applied to you?
    - Do you ever have problems with too much conversational flow

## [On Breaking The Script](https://lexicaldoll.wordpress.com/2017/09/03/on-breaking-the-script/)
- Conversations often fall into scripts
    - Example: "How are you doing" "Fine, thanks"
    - Many conversations fall into scripts
    - Even if the words aren't literally scripted, responses are often from a limited number of pre-determined categories
    - While scripts are safe and comfortable, it can be profitable to break out of scripts
- When looking for a script breaker, what should you keep in mind?
    - Goal
    - Unusualness
    - Accessibility
    - Specificity
    - Audience
    - Playfulness
- Goal
    - What are you actually after by asking a weird question and breaking the script?
    - Whenever you do anything deliberate in a conversation, keep your goals in mind
    - By being mindful about your goals, you can efficiently turn initial responses into an enjoyable conversation
- Unusualness
    - The question has to be a little weird to break out of the script
    - If you were asked the question, would you have to stop and think, or would you be able to answer it instantly?
- Accessibility
    - The other person has to be able to answer the question
    - If the question is too esoteric, the other person won't be able to map that question to their personal experience
- Specificity
    - Is the question specific enough to be answerable
    - If you make your question too broad, people will either spit out a rehearsed answer or they'll freeze up
    - Adding constraints helps
- Audience
    - Where are you trying to control the conversational frame?
    - Know who you're talking to and change which questions you ask in response
    - Consider what the other person would find most fun
- Playfulness
    - Don't forget to have fun and show that you're having fun
    - The point of script-breaking is to be fun and spontaneous
    - If people think you're being strategic or attempting to gain an advantage, they'll refuse the question
- Additional things to pay attention to
    - Delivery
    - Context
    - Consider the above to be guidelines, but don't be constrained by them

## [On The Nature of Hypnosis](https://lexicaldoll.wordpress.com/2017/12/18/on-the-nature-of-hypnosis/)
- The commonality between all depictions of hypnosis is focus
- Hypnosis can be modeled as a focus hijack
    - Taking someone's focus and directing it in one direction
    - Leaves opening for suggestions to take hold
    - Model of hypnosis opens up possibilities in therms of how to set up the space for hypnosis, how to create inductions, and how to awaken
- Inductions
    - Subject needs to be comfortable with you and being put into a trance by you
    - Any hesitance of the part of the subject is stealing focus
    - Once the hypnosis conversation starts, go gradually and build up a trance
    - Make sure the subject is physically comfortable
    - Actual induction is relatively trivial - give them something to concentrate on and reinforce natural bodily response
- Awakeners
    - Opposite of inductions
    - Release someone's attention and allow it to become theirs again
    - Hypnosis can be seen as the opposite of meditation
        - Meditation is about taking active control of your own focus
        - Hypnosis is about outsourcing your focus to someone else
    - A good awakener is gentle, slowly raising the subject from their trance
- This model of hypnosis as focus hijack allows a deeper exploration of what attention is and how it acts as a resource in a modern society
- Model removes much of the esoterica from hypnosis
- Discussion questions
    - How much does the focus hijack model resonate with your hypnotic experiences
    - What are the gaps and flaws in this model?
