## Why Philosophy
- All life attempts to maintain homeostasis
- The more complex the life, the more complex the homeostasis that has to be maintained
- People are extraordinarily complex creatures and thus have to maintain an extraordinarily complex homeostasis
- In order to acquire resources to maintain homeostasis, we must balance between two competing approaches
  - Exploit existing resources
  - Find new resources
- Philosophy is about deciding how and when to strike out for new resources versus continuing to exploit existing resources
- "Resources" defined broadly
  - Models of the world
  - Ways of living in the world

## Nietzsche
- Nietzsche thought that society had over-optimized towards preserving and exploiting existing sources of value rather than striking out into the unknown
- Wanted more people to go out into the "wilderness" of unexplored and radical ideas to find new sources of value for themselves and for society
- Felt like the pendulum had swung too far in the direction of stability, on the continuum of stability vs. exploration
- Wanted a return to a more Roman-esque set of values, where people were rewarded for going out and finding new sources of value for their civilization
- Thought that society was *forgetting* how to explore - people didn't realize how much preparation and resouces were required to productively explore unknown physical and mental terrains

## How Does This Apply To Your Life
- Local maxima exist at every level, including ordinary day-to-day life
- You should look at your own life and think about whether what you're doing is working out as well as well as it could be
- Think about how you're gaining value from how you relate to other people
- Realize that it's unlikely that you'll get to a new global optimum by continuuing to iterate on a local maximum
- In order for society to progress, we need people to go out and explore ideas that are considered "beyond the pale"
- However, exploration requires preparation, you can't abandon stable sources of value on a whim
  - Know the limits of your field
  - Invest in acquiring the material resources needed to ensure that you'll have enough time to explore a new field
