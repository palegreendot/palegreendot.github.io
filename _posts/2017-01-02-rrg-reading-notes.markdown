## Reading Notes

### [Mr. Jaynes' Wild Ride](http://www.meltingasphalt.com/mr-jaynes-wild-ride/)
* _[The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind](http://www.worldcat.org/title/origin-of-consciousness-in-the-breakdown-of-the-bicameral-mind/oclc/2401662&referer=brief_results)_
* Probably wrong, but worth taking seriously
* Why should we take it seriously if it's wrong?
* Jaynes is asking big questions that haven't been asked before, and even if his answers are wrong in the specifics, they're still interesting to think about
* Jaynes' big question: what does the transition between an ape-mind and a modern human mind look like?
* Metaphors for consciousness
  * Start by viewing our own consciousness as weird
  * Consciousness: awareness of awareness
    * "Private headspace"
    * "Cartesian theater"
  * We think our consciousness is unified and private when psychology and neuroscience tell us otherwise, repeatedly
  * This metaphor for our mind isn't natural, it had to be invented
* Language as a window into the mind
  * Translating from one language to another becomes more difficult as concepts become more abstract
  * Mental concepts are the most difficult to translate
  * Consider the _Iliad_ - what if the psychology of the ancient Greeks was significantly different from our own?
  * According to Jaynes, the Iliad portrays a folk theory of the mind that's split into pieces corresponding to different parts of the body
* The birth of dualism
  * Ancient Greeks don't have a word for "body"
  * This implies that they don't have the same concept of a mind/body distinction that we do
  * In turn, this implies that dualism is the invented concept - people started with monism
  * So if we want to understand what conscious experience was like for the Ancient Greeks, we have to think monistically - try to understand what it's like to live without a mind/body distinction

### [Accepting Deviant Minds](http://www.meltingasphalt.com/accepting-deviant-minds/)
* We have strong biases about what's possible and legitimate as a conscious experience
* We need to get past these biases if we're to understand how people from another time thought
* Menagerie of the mind
  * The brain is capable of being in many different states that support conscious experiences of some kind
* The question of legitimacy
  * Not only are brains plastic, but society is plastic too
  * Many brain-states considered deviant today were within the normal range of experience at other times in history
  * For example, if people lost the ability to daydream, at some point, they'd look back and think that daydreaming was extremely weird
    * Might not even know what we meant by the term
* Trances
  * Even though trances have the air of the occult about them, we go into mild trance-states all the time
  * Possession
    * A very deep trance
    * Like self-induced hypnosis
    * A different part of your brain is in control, but it's still your brain
* Hallucinations
  * Even though hallucinations don't exist outside our brains, they still have real effects on us
  * The fact that society treats them as illegitimate doesn't mean they're not real
* Maybe the greatest hallucination is the concept of a consciousness that is separate from the body

### [Neurons Gone Wild](http://www.meltingasphalt.com/neurons-gone-wild/)
* Can we come up with a scientific explanation for religious experiences?
* Neurons, selfish and feral
  * "Selfish" neurons
  * Neurons are in a state of competition for resources
  * Mental activity feeds neurons
  * This competition is the key behind neuroplasticity - neurons actively join more active networks in order to gain resources
* Agents all the way down
  * Agent - any entity capable of autonomous goal-directed behavior
  * Agency is a matter of degrees
  * Agency is not inherent to the system, but is ascribed to the system by post-hoc analysis
  * Agency is a fundamental property of the brain
  * Because neurons have a higher level of agency than other cells, the brain is configured to run agents by default
* Level 2: Modules
  * We can describe the brain at a slightly higher level of abstraction as hundreds or thousands of cooperating and competing modules
  * According to Dennett and Seung, these modules have the same sort of selfishness as the neurons they're made from
* Level 3: Subpersonal Agents
  * Drives/instincts
  * Can "feel" these agents via introspection
  * These agents aren't capable of using language, but we still speak of them "telling" us things
* Level 4: The self
  * Social agent
  * Not in control, but is the "voice" of the most powerful faction in our mind
* Birth Defects in the Self
  * Is the human mind capable of supporting multiple self-agents?
* Multiple occupancy
  * There are multiple psychological disorders where there appear to be multiple agents in the brain
  * Schizophrenia - hallucinated voices
  * Disassociative identity disorder - 2 or more person-like agents in the same brain
  * Posession trances - "gods" who temporarily inhabit minds
  * Split-brain - when communication between parts of the brain is severed, each half acts like its own agent
  * Could these agents be independently sentient?
* Agent horticulture
  * Tulpas - trying to create additional agents
* Taking demons seriously
  * What is the psychological or anthropological explanation for demon possession and exorcism?
  * Can we think of curing possession as changing the agent that's in control of the brain?
  * The exorcist is a person with the moral authority to negotiate with the currently dominant agent and persuade them to relinquish control

### [Hallucinated Gods](http://www.meltingasphalt.com/hallucinated-gods/)
* Julian Jaynes believes that people experienced gods as auditory hallucinations
* The human mind is clearly capable of hallucinating voices
  * Not just deviant minds hallucinate voices - many people hallucinate voices when they dream
  * Whatever the brain can do when it's asleep it can, in principle, do when it's awake
* Jaynes is proposing that the brain is capable of hosting multiple independent intelligences
* The "Bicameral" mind
  * Thesis: people had one or more gods (independent agents) living in their brains
  * Independent agents, rather than being subordinate, are peers of primary self
  * A person living in Sumer in 2000 BC would be much like us, except that they would experience auditory hallucinations that they would interpret as being the voices of gods
  * Gods would probably speak up during novel and stressful situations
  * Like "gut feelings" with voices
* Training the Gods
  * Like all agents in the brain, gods have to be trained to speak
  * Done by internalizing the voices of authority figures
  * Helped along by external triggers
    * Temples
    * Idols
    * Hallucinogens
  * How did people know that they were hearing the same gods? They didn't.
  * Ascribing a particular god to a voice was an act of interpretation, guided by social norms
* Psychosocial phenomena
  * Bicameral gods where both neurological and cultural phenomena
  * Linked by an interpretive act - identification
  * This makes ancient religion a psychosocial phenomenon
  * This link between cultural norms and indvidual agents can be used by priests to enforce social norms and social controls
* Banality of the Gods
  * If you read closely, the ancients did talk about hallucinating their gods - they just didn't make a big deal out of it
  * Ancient texts speak of relating to gods and divinity on a much more personal and visceral level than we do today
  * The reason ancient gods seem so much more human-like than modern gods is because they were much more closely tied to human brains
  * No skepticism around people personally relating to gods
* The Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind
  * Some time between 1250 BC and 500 BC, people stop believing in gods in this way
  * Lots of literature written in this time period has a common theme of people being forsaken by their gods
  * After the breakdown of the bicameral mind, people had to relearn how to make decisions
    * This is why so many methods of divination are invented during this time period
* Conclusion
  * Jaynes makes extraordinary claims, and while he does back up his claims with some evidence, the evidence he produces is nowhere near enough to validate those claims
  * It may be possible that he's wrong in the details, but he may very well be right in the broad outlines
