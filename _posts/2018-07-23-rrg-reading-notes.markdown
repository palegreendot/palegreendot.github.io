## [Neurons Gone Wild](http://www.meltingasphalt.com/neurons-gone-wild/)

([From our discussion on 2017-01-02](https://palegreendot.net/rrg_notes/2017/01/01/rrg-reading-notes.html#neurons-gone-wild))

- Can we come up with a scientific explanation for religious experiences?
- Neurons, selfish and feral
  - "Selfish" neurons
  - Neurons are in a state of competition for resources
  - Mental activity feeds neurons
  - This competition is the key behind neuroplasticity - neurons actively join more active networks in order to gain resources
- Agents all the way down
  - Agent - any entity capable of autonomous goal-directed behavior
  - Agency is a matter of degrees
  - Agency is not inherent to the system, but is ascribed to the system by post-hoc analysis
  - Agency is a fundamental property of the brain
  - Because neurons have a higher level of agency than other cells, the brain is configured to run agents by default
- Level 2: Modules
  - We can describe the brain at a slightly higher level of abstraction as hundreds or thousands of cooperating and competing modules
  - According to Dennett and Seung, these modules have the same sort of selfishness as the neurons they're made from
- Level 3: Subpersonal Agents
  - Drives/instincts
  - Can "feel" these agents via introspection
  - These agents aren't capable of using language, but we still speak of them "telling" us things
- Level 4: The self
  - Social agent
  - Not in control, but is the "voice" of the most powerful faction in our mind
- Birth Defects in the Self
  - Is the human mind capable of supporting multiple self-agents?
- Multiple occupancy
  - There are multiple psychological disorders where there appear to be multiple agents in the brain
  - Schizophrenia - hallucinated voices
  - Disassociative identity disorder - 2 or more person-like agents in the same brain
  - Posession trances - "gods" who temporarily inhabit minds
  - Split-brain - when communication between parts of the brain is severed, each half acts like its own agent
  - Could these agents be independently sentient?
- Agent horticulture
  - Tulpas - trying to create additional agents
- Taking demons seriously
  - What is the psychological or anthropological explanation for demon possession and exorcism?
  - Can we think of curing possession as changing the agent that's in control of the brain?
  - The exorcist is a person with the moral authority to negotiate with the currently dominant agent and persuade them to relinquish control

## [Highly Advanced Tulpamancy 101 For Beginners](https://hivewired.wordpress.com/2017/05/27/highly-advanced-tulpamancy-101-for-beginners/)

- We don't model ourselves as a chaotic system of firing neurons, we model ourselves as a single discrete individual in the world
- We think of the self as a distinct entity
- However, this entity is far less well-defined than other entities in the world
    - We can add almost any attribute to our self-model
        - Physical characteristics
        - Personality type
- This broad conception of the self can be adaptive or maladaptive depending on the circumstance
    - Allows for greater group unity and cohesion - an attack on our group can feel like an attack on us, personally
    - However, we can also take negative labels associated with groups and associate them with ourselves -- e.g. if you think people with depression are lazy, then receiving a diagnosis of depression can cause you to think that you're lazy
- We define the our self both extensionally and intensionally:
    - Extensional self-definition
        - Perception - what our senses tell us about the outside world
        - Internal mind voice - internal mologue or dialogue
        - Emotion - people experience emotions at differing levels of intensity and this feeds into our sense of self
        - Bodily sensations - pain, hunger, etc
        - Abstract thought - mental images, imagined scenes, math, etc.
        - Memory - experience of calling up past events or experiences
        - Choice - experience of having control over our lives
    - Intensional self-definition
        - People choose various attributes about themselves to emphasize
        - This choice of attributes (hobbies, race, religion, etc) is your intensional self-definition
    - This self-definition creates a "self-schema" -- a collection of memories, attitudes, demeanors, generalizations, etc. that defines how the person interacts with the world
- People can have different self-schemas for different situations
- A _tulpa_ is a highly developed and partitioned self-schema that is "always on"
- The challenge with creating a tulpa is to extend to self-schema split beyond the intensional definition of the self and into the extensional definition, so that you can perceive the world and yourself differently
- Changing our extensional self-definition is more difficult and dangerous than changing our intentional self-definition, but it is possible to compartmentalize these changes
- How to tulpa
    - First, learn how to create a mental compartment
        - Pick an idea
        - Put all the evidence you have supporting the idea into that compartment
        - When the idea generates a correct prediction, put the positive reinforcement into the compartment
        - When the idea fails to generate a correct prediction, keep the negative reinforcement out of the compartment -- just tell yourself, "Oh well, it was just a compartment"
    - Pick the beliefs that you have, then sort them into compartments
    - Regulate information intake, consciously deciding which compartment new information should go into before you internalize it
    - Once this sorting process becomes automatic, you'll have multiple compartments, each holding radically different beliefs about the world
    - Each of these compartments is a tulpa
- Failure modes
    - The most common failure mode is that the tulpa doesn't seem to be "talking back"
    - You have to put beliefs and experiences into your Tulpa in order for it to do things
    - Your sense of self is how your sorting and information processing algorithms feel from the inside - if your sense of self is unchanged, then you really haven't managed to change your mental algorithms
- The real trick with tulpas is to see yourself as a collection of entities, not a unitary person

## [Highly Advanced Tulpamancy 201 For Tropers](https://hivewired.wordpress.com/2018/03/23/highly-advanced-tulpamancy-201-for-tropers/) 

- In the [previous essay](https://hivewired.wordpress.com/2017/05/27/highly-advanced-tulpamancy-101-for-beginners/), we saw how we can alter the process the brain uses to create a self and use it to create multiple selves
- But this raises more questions
    - What does it mean to give up control of the body and the senses
    - How can you do this without permanently damaging yourself?
- Start with the question of how we create our identity, as a singleton
    - Take in or discard parts of our identity, based upon our worldview
    - Many parts of our identity, especially those having to do with our inner-selves, are defined solely by the way we say they're defined
    - More precisely, these parts of our identity are defined by the self-reinforcing narratives we create for ourselves
    - These beliefs have a strong influence on whether we can do something by influencing our motivation and our priors for success
    - Our minds normally model the world in terms of high-level entities that often don't directly correspond to things in the world, and changing our narrative can change the process by which we model the world
- Chuunibyou Hosts On Turbo Gender
    - At some point everyone realizes that they're an independent person, capable of making choices about who they are and who they want to be
    - When children realize this, they often act out or behave strangely
    - Usually what happens is that under social pressure people rein in their weirdness and become more normal and well-adjusted
    - However, the moment in which people understand that they can change their identity is of interest - can we have more than one such moment?
- Plato's Caving Adventure
    - In Plato's analogy, you don't perceive the world directly; you perceive the "shadows" the world casts upon your senses
    - At this point, you can do one of two things
        - "Smoothen" the cave wall to perceive the outside world more clearly
        - "Carve" the cave wall to manipulate how the shadows appear
    - Almost everything about your inner self is decided, either directly or indirectly, by you
- A Brief Detour Through Enlightenment
    - Cognitive fusion
        - Person becomes so invested in the content of a thought or an emotion that the content of the thought or emotion is taken as a fact about the world
        - This can be helpful or harmful, depending on the thought
    - The Buddhists think of the mind as a set of interacting subagents or thoughts
    - There is a narrative agent, the "I", which takes the output of these interacting subagents and knits them into a coherents self
    - We are cognitively fused with this agent
    - It is possible to unfuse ourselves from our sense of 'I'
    - Once you have done this, it is possible to change the story that you're telling about yourself, and even enact stories that have multiple characters
- A Return To Cognitive Trope Therapy
    - You can make your life a lot more pleasant by choosing the correct narrative spin to put on events
    - The process of creating tulpas is taking the subagents in your mind and treating them as characters in a story
    - Once you have done this, it's easier to alter the story you're telling about yourself
    - However, you do need to make sure that you retain some level of conscious control
    - The stories we tell about ourselves give us a sense of purpose and meaning, by stimulating our emotions more strongly than reality
- Storytelling, character creation and GM-ing your life
    - The first thing to decide when turning your life into a narrative is what genre your story is
    - Genre defines the tropes that you'll use to interpret events in your life
    - Your internal narrative can be as weird as you want it to be, so long as it produces good outcomes on the outside
    - Having awareness of your internal narrative is a good thing - you can control it and change it so that it's not having a negative impact on your life
    - Everything you do is, to some extent, performative, even if the only audience is yourself
    - So take control and choose the kind of character you want to be

## [The People In My Head Who Make Me Do Things](https://agentyduck.blogspot.com/2016/04/the-people-in-my-head-who-make-me-do.html)

([Previously discussed on October 30, 2017](https://palegreendot.net/rrg_notes/2017/10/30/rrg-reading-notes.html#the-people-in-my-head-who-make-me-do-things))

- It can be helpful to cluster your motivations and assign a persona to each cluster
- Recognize that each of your motivations has a role and purpose
- Might be helpful to be more explicit about giving different parts of yourself a chance to be at the forefront
