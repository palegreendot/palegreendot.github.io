## Reading Notes

### [Troubleshooting Emotion Regulation](https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2015/11/19/troubleshooting-emotion-regulation/)
* Most of the time, emotion regulation works pretty well
  * Notice that our emotions don't fit the situation and alter them so that they do
  * However, in certain situations, automatic emotion regulation doesn't kick in, and we have to regulate manually
* Checklist for troubleshooting emotion regulation
  * Are you in crisis?
    * Signs that you're in crisis
      * Feeling overwhelmed?
      * Can't think about anything except emotion
      * Can't take in new information
      * Hard time solving problems
      * Self-destructive urges
    * If you're in crisis, use the [crisis survival skills](https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2015/09/08/dbt-sequence-crisis-survival/) until you feel better and can handle the situation
  * Are you biologically vulnerable?
    * Symptoms
      * Sick?
      * In pain?
      * Hungry?
      * Did you sleep enough?
      * Drunk/high?
      * Did you miss a dose of your medication?
      * Miss exercise?
      * Temperature: too hot/too cold?
      * Have to interact with something you're sensitive to (bright lights, loud noises, etc)?
    * If you can solve these problems relatively quickly, do so
      * Eat something
      * Put on a sweater
      * Take a nap
    * Even if you can't do anything about your vulnerability, acknowledging it and identifying it as the source of your emotion can be helpful
  * Can you quickly solve whatever it is you're upset about?
    * Is your problem actually relatively easily solvable?
    * Can you muster the willpower to solve your problem now?
  * Mindfulness of current emotion
    * Step back and notice what you're feeling
    * Treat it like an event
    * Don't act on your feeling - just notice it
    * Don't try to block the emotion
    * Don't try to amplify the emotion
    * Notice where in your body you feel the emotion
    * Separate yourself from the emotion - instead of thinking "I am x", think "I'm feeling/experiencing x"
    * Don't judge your emotions
      * Your emotions evolved to help keep you safe and happy
      * Try to be curious and respectful
    * Do you even know which emotion you're feeling right now?
      * Try looking at the [big glossary of emotions](https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2015/10/20/understanding-and-naming-emotions/) to figure out what you're feeling
    * Is there anything you need to Radically Accept?
      * Are you committed to doing the best you can with the resources you have?
      * Or are you angry about how everything seems to be so unfair?
      * If the latter, [radical acceptance](https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2015/09/15/dbt-sequence-radical-acceptance/) may help
    * Are there myths about emotions getting in the way?
      * Do you think you should be feeling a different emotion than what you currently are feeling?
      * Try to process your emotion nonjudgementally
      * Describe your situation as factually as possible
      * Think dialectically
        * Ask yourself, why should I be feeling a different emotion?
        * Then ask yourself why shouldn't you be feeling that emotion?
    * Is there some benefit that you're getting from this emotion?
      * Does your emotion feel good?
      * Does it communicate things to others?
      * Does your emotion motivate you to do things that you want/need to do?
      * Does your emotion legitimate your beliefs or identity?
      * It's important not to regulate emotions that have benefits; at least figure out how you're going to get your needs met without the emotion
  * Finally use emotion regulation skills
    * First, actually use the skills
      * Knowing about emotion regulation skills won't help you if you don't actually put them into practice
    * Second, use appropriate skills
      * Using distress tolerance on a problem that you can solve just means that you're avoiding/running-away
      * Using opposite action on a feeling of guilt might make you apologize for something where you were actually in the wrong
    * Finally, make sure you're using your skills appropriately
      * Make sure to separate facts from interpretation

### [Mindfulness: What is Mindfulness](https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2015/12/03/mindfulness-what-is-mindfulness/)
* Mindfulness is all about slowing down, seeing everything as if it was the first time you saw it, and experiencing all the richness of reality
  * Living with awareness of the present moment
  * Not suppressing or clinging to the past
  * Not overly anticipating any particular future
  * Accepting reality as it is
  * Letting go of situations that you can't control
  * Approaching situations instead of avoiding them
  * Making wise and effective choices
* Mindlessness is like walking a familiar route, thinking about something else, and then realizing that you're at your destination without knowing how you got there
  * Stuck in patterns or habits
  * Trapped in counterproductive behavior
  * Bored/preoccupied
  * Unfocused
  * Multitasking
  * Treating interpretations of situations as if they were facts
  * Avoiding things that are painful or upsetting
  * Being overwhelmed by negative emotions
* How do you do mindfulness?
  * Meditation
    * Spend a few minutes focusing on something or paying attention to awareness itself
  * Religion
    * Most religious practices have some kind of mindfulness
    * Prayer, yoga, etc
  * Incorporate mindfulness into exercise
* When you start mindfulness, you'll be bad at it
  * Important to be kind and gentle with yourself
  * Beating yourself up about not being able to be mindful will only make it harder to be mindful in the future
* Mindfulness is especially difficult for people with depression
  * Depression both leads to rumination and overanalysis and avoidance/suppression
  * Many depressed people do things to numb out negative emotion
    * Food
    * Entertainment
    * Sleep
  * The problem is that this doesn't actually make the negative emotion go away - just pushes it to the background
  * This often leads to worse depression in the future
  * What's worse, this numbing makes it difficult to feel joy
* But why should we be mindful? Isn't being lost in thought how we think of cool things?
  * Yes, but a lot of the time, we're not lost in thought because we're solving a problem or thinking of a cool thing
  * We're lost in thought, thinking about the same (negative) things we thought about the last time we got lost in thought
* How to switch from mindlessness to mindfulness?
  * Switch from thinking to experiencing
  * Observe the sensations in your body
  * Be aware that your thoughts are just thoughts
    * They're mental events
    * Interpretations of events that may be appropriate or inappropriate

### [Mindfulness: Doing and Being Mind](https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2015/12/09/mindfulness-doing-and-being-mind/)
* Three stages to unhappiness:
  * First we feel unhappy
  * Second we have thoughts about our emotions
    * Difference between chronically depressed and non-depressed people
      * Non-depressed people think, "I'm sad"
      * Depressed people think, "I'm worthless"
      * This often leads to poor coping mechanisms
  * Third we try to deal with emotions: Doing Mind and Being Mind
* Doing mind
  * Thinking
  * Planning
  * Goal-setting
  * Problem-solving
  * In order to achieve your goals, though, you need to examine your current state
  * Sometimes examining your current state is painful - this is where being mind comes in
* Being mind
  * Curiosity about your mood
  * Acceptance of current situation
  * Being in the present moment
  * Noticing experience without having an agenda
* Other differences between being mind and doing mind
  * Being mind is not about suppressing or invalidating your emotions
  * Doing mind is about being goal focused, doing things without even noticing that you're doing them
  * Being mind experiences feelings and sensations directly
  * Doing mind treats thoughts about things as if they were the things themselves
  * Being mind is in the present moment
  * Doing mind is "mental time-travel" - ruminating about the past, or worrying about the future
  * Being mind approaches unpleasant experiences with interest, curiosity and respect
  * Doing mind avoids or destroys unpleasant experiences
  * Being mind doesn't expect that reality fit with our ideals
  * Doing mind is acutely conscious of the flaws in reality and wants to fix them (preferably *now*)
  * Being mind values the quality of the moment
  * Doing mind is about pursuing goals and and plans
* We cannot live in being mind or doing mind 100% - we should seek to balance the two in "wise mind"
* Synthesis, rather than compromise
* How do you develop wise mind?
  * Strategically posting reminders to stay in wise mind
  * Randomly reminding yourself to be mindful
  * Select one thing to do every day and try to be mindful about it
  * When overwhelmed, do things one at a time
  * Notice events in your everyday life
  * Staying aware of what needs to be done, even when relaxing
  * Practice willingness to do what is needed, even when it's unpleasant in the moment
  * Pausing and asking yourself, "What am I thinking? What am I feeling? What are the sensations in my body?"
  * Stopping during unpleasant experiences to notice your feelings and sensations
  * Regular meditation practice

### [Mindfulness: Six Mindfulness Skills](https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2015/12/18/mindfulness-six-mindfulness-skills/)
* Three "what" skills and three "how" skills
* What skills:
  * Observe
    * Pay attention, intentionally, to the present moment
    * Try to notice all the details of a thing or situation
  * Describe
    * Put words to your experience
    * Describe only the facts, not your interpretations or opinions
  * Participate
    * Throw yourself into the current experience
    * Observing and describing are tools to help participation
* How skills:
  * Non-judgementally
    * Differentiate between facts about external reality and your judgements about those facts
    * "I am bad" is not a fact, it is a judgement
    * If you find yourself judging something, notice it and try to extract the facts out of your judgement
    * Don't recursively judge yourself for judging something
  * One-mindfully
    * Be present in the moment
    * Do one thing at a time
  * Effectively
    * Know what your goals and make sure that what you're doing is, at the very least, not taking you further away from your goals
    * Focus on what works, not what your emotional urges are telling you to do
    * Make a list of emotions that consistently cause you to be ineffective
    * Whenever you notice those emotions, ask yourself, "Is this effective?"

### [Mindfulness: Thoughts Are Not Reality](https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2015/12/19/mindfulness-thoughts-are-not-reality/)
* Don't believe everything you think
* You don't have to believe everything your brain is saying just because it's your brain
* However, there is a big difference between knowing intellectually that your brain is lying and knowing it emotionally
* You can use meditation to build up this emotional awareness:
  * Instead of instantly trying to refocus, pause to recognize what you're thinking about
  * Try focusing on and describing thoughts
  * Don't overexert yourself - three to four minutes is enough
* When you're upset, try doing nothing
  * First stop
  * Then carefully take awareness away from thoughts and into bodily sensations
  * Notice that thoughts come and go, and that they're not the same as facts
  * Try writing your thoughts down
