## [In Favor of Niceness, Community and Civilization](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/02/23/in-favor-of-niceness-community-and-civilization/)
* In order to win, do we have to embrace "politics is the mindkiller" and "arguments are soldiers"?
* If politics is war, why not use bullets, both real and rhetorical?
* So why not use violence?
    * Violence isn't sustainable - neither side can annihilate the other
    * So both sides agree to compromise and form a government
        * Example: Good Friday Accords ending the conflict in Northern Ireland
        * General case: civilization
* Unfortunately, this just moves the conflict, rather than ending it
    * Both sides attempt to use the government against each other
    * This runs into the same problem as above - neither side can control the government indefinitely, so neither side can use the government to permanently oppress the other
    * Both sides then agree to certain restrictions in how they can use the government, such as the preservation of minority rights
    * In the US, this is most notably seen in the 1st and 14th amendments
    * The general case is liberalism
* But why are civilization and liberalism stable equlibria?
    * Combination of reciprocal communitarianism and "divine grace"
    * Reciprocal communitarianism
        * Probably how altruism evolved
        * Once you have a small community of individuals all cooperating with each other in a tit-for-tat manner, then others either have to join the community or be outcompeted
    * "Divine grace"
        * People successfully interact with others holding opposing values all the time
        * Reading ancient and medieval texts, there is nothing but honor among foes
            * Standards of honorable conduct for Greek and Roman warriors
            * Codes of chivalry in the Middle Ages
        * Even today, there are instances of groups at war cooperating, such as the Christmas Truce in World War 1
    * Most useful social norms exist due to a combination of reciprocal communitarianism and divine grace
    * As a result, groups with liberal values attract members and groups that are more hostile lose them
* Another advantage of liberalism is that it fails gracefully
    * If it turns out that the group you're fighting is not evil or immoral, liberalism at least allows you the consolation of having treated them with civility
    * This is opposed to politics-as-war, where persecution of the outgroup just leads to the outgroup persecuting you when they gain power
* So why should we be worried when people claiming to value liberalism use illiberal tactics
    * They're undermining the basis of the community
    * Making exceptions to your values for particular outgroups is a great way to ensure the collapse of your community
* Scott names the demiurge of liberalism Elua, after the god from *Kushiel's Avatar*

## [Why The Culture Wins: An Appreciation of Iain M. Banks](http://sciphijournal.org/why-the-culture-wins-an-appreciation-of-iain-m-banks/)
* Banks, unlike other science fiction writers, considered how culture would evolve alongside technology
* Cultures are "functional" insofar as they help overcome collective action problems that stand in the way of the production of necessary goods and services
    * Food, shelter, clothing
    * Security, justice
* Banks considers what happens when technological advancements free culture from the constraints of having to contribute to the production of these essential goods and services
* When all cultures do equally well at providing essential goods and services, cultures compete on the basis of memetics
* The culture that becomes dominant will be the culture that spreads most easily by appealing to the tastes and sensibilities of sentient species
* That is The Culture in Banks' novels
* This is why Horza, the protagonist of *Consider Phlebas* dislikes The Culture
    * Horza is a member of the Idiran Empire
    * Idirans are religious zealots, so why would anyone choose them over The Culture?
    * Idirans have a certain depth and seriousness that The Culture lacks
* The problem with The Culture is that it provides no deeper meaning - nothing but constant partying, with unlimited sex and drugs
* However, this decadence should not be mistaken for weakness
    * Historically cultures that became this decadent *were* weak
    * Technology changes the equation
* The Culture is the ultimate choice-oriented society, and, as a result, it suffers from a crisis of meaning
    * What happens when work disappears and everything becomes a hobby?
    * What happens when you can choose all aspects of yourself
        * Gender
        * Knowledge
        * Psychology
    * How do you define your identity?
* Societies have two reactions to this crisis
    * Re-embrace traditionalism
    * Affirm freedom itself as the sole meaningful value and work to bring that value to others
* The latter is what defines The Culture
    * The Culture has a branch called Contact, whose role it is to ensure that when new species are encountered, they adopt The Culture
    * Accomplishes this by supporting "good" factions among the species and opposing "evil" ones
    * Thus The Culture perpetuates itself by ensuring the "good guys" win
* The Culture, upon closer examination, is much like The Borg
* Banks' great trick was, in essence, to make us sypathetic to The Borg and to suggest that modern liberal societies are fundamentally Borg-like

## [How The West Was Won](http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/07/25/how-the-west-was-won/)
* Response to Bryan Caplan's [A Hardy Weed: How Traditionalists Underestimate Western Civilization](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2014/06/a_hardy_week_ho.html)
    * Argues that so-called defenders of Western civilization don't give it enough credit
    * Western culture is successfully conquering other cultures, even in the face of determined opposition
    * Spreads not through war and conquest but by persuasion and conversion
* The problem is that Caplan is eliding Western culture pre- and post-Industrial Revolution
* There's nothing fundamentally Western about much of "Western" culture
    * Example: Coca-Cola
        * Combination of an Ethiopian nut, a Columbian leaf, along with lots of carbonated sugar water
        * Would be equally delicious and would spread equally well if it had been discovered in Japan or Arabia
    * Example: gender norms
        * "Western" gender norms would be unrecognizable to e.g. Cicero or St. Augustine
        * What we consider to be Western gender norms are actually the result of the Industrial Revolution, and are necessary for the successful function of an industrialized civilization
        * As other countries industrialize, they adopt "Western" gender norms, not because they're being conquered by the West but because those norms are more efficient
* As a result, what many people call "Western" culture is actually "universalist" culture
    * As societies industrialize, they converge on the same cultural norms
    * The rate at which places get inducted into universal culture depends on their connectedness to globalized trade
* Universal culture is the only culture that can survive without censorship, since it, by definition, outcompetes native cultures
* Universal culture is the only culture that can survive high levels of immigration
    * Adapted to work in diverse multicultural environments
    * Social atomization - allows people to have their own values while broader society provides a baseline of least-common-denominator functions
    * People will increasingly default to universal culture norms in public whenever there are high levels of immigration
    * It's not that foreigners are assimilating into Western culture, it's that both Westerners and foreigners are assimilating into a new universalist culture
* There is a certain level of hypocrisy in our embrace of universalist culture
    * We lament when universalist culture takes over far-away and exotic traditionalist cultures
    * We celebrate when universalist culture takes over traditionalist cultures that we consider to be the outgroup
* We should be consistent 
    * If we're happy when universalist culture conquers Southern Baptists, we should also be happy when universalist culture conquers traditional African societies
    * If we're unhappy when universalist culture conquers traditional African societies, we should be unhappy when it conquers Southern Baptists
* The main thing though, is to get rid of this notion that Western culture and universalist culture are the same

## [Why Do You Hate Elua?](https://hivewired.wordpress.com/2017/07/05/why-do-you-hate-elua/)
* Elua (liberalism, universal culture, etc) is slowly consuming everything in its path
* That said, Elua appears to be good
* So why are people trying to hard to fight Elua?
* Elua can be reprogrammed
* Nationalism is what you get when the machinery of liberalism is "reprogrammed" with a different, more traditionalist value set
