## [My Bayesian Englightenment](http://lesswrong.com/lw/ul/my_bayesian_enlightenment/)
- Even though Eliezer knew about Bayes theorem and cognitive biases, he didn't think of himself as a Bayesian until he read E.T. Jaynes' _Probability Theory: The Logic of Science_
- The only way to tackle truly difficult problems is to look for solutions that are so rigorous, they seem like the only solution, not just one solution out of many
- Can't just show why your way will work, have to show why other ways will not work
- Holding yourself to that greater level of rigor saves time, not on the order of weeks or months, but on the order of decades and careers
- Saying "Oops" is something to look forward to

## [What Should We Be Worried About](https://www.edge.org/response-detail/23879)
- The problem with the "10,000 hours" theory of excellence is that it encourages focused effort towards a local maximum
- The skills needed for this form of excellence don't help one make truly novel discoveries, nor do they help communities
- Sewall Wright's theory of adaptive landscapes of fitness corresponds to four archetypes of acheivement:
  - Climbing -- Expertise: climbing towards the current (local) fitness maximum
  - Crossing -- Genius: Crossing the "adaptive valley" towards an even higher maximum level of fitness
  - Moving -- Heroism: Altering the landscape of fitness to favor a particular group
  - Shaking -- Rebellion: Changing the landscaping of fitness to be more even
- The problem is that modern institutions emphasize the climbing form of adaptations over all others
- Need alternative institutions to traditional academia for people who want to pursue paths other than the 10,000 hours theory of excellence

## [Intensity of Emotion Tied To Perception and Thinking](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/17/science/intensity-of-emotion-tied-to-perception-and-thinking.html)
- People have differing levels of emotional intensity
  - Some people feel emotions (both positive and negative) very intensely
  - Others have more muted emotions
- Muted emotional expression doesn't necessarily imply muted emotions 
- People with a wide range of emotional expression report similar levels of contentment and life satisfaction
- People with intense emotions personalize and focus on the emotional aspects of a situation, whereas people with less intense emotions focus on the factual aspects of the situation
- Emotional intensity appears to be heritable, with identical twins showing greater similarities in emotional intensity than fraternal twins
- Emotional intensity appears to decline with age, with the greatest drop occurring between one's 20s and one's 40s
- More emotionally intense people appear to have less physiological activity at rest than less emotionally intense people
- the more strongly a person feels emotions, the less they appear to understand those emotions

## [Against Unreasonably High Standards](https://unstableontology.com/2017/07/10/against-unreasonably-high-standards/)
- Consider the following procedure:
  - Create unreasonably high standards
  - When people fail to meet those standards, assign them "debt"
  - Provide some way for people to discharge that debt by giving up agency
- Examples:
  - Christianity:
    - Define many natural human emotions as sins
    - Define subserviency to Jesus/church as a way to discharge debts accumulated by sinning
  - Education system
    - Define standards of behavior that are impossible to follow
    - Discharge debt by accepting punishments and displaying your subservience to the educational system
  - Effective altruism
    - Enjoying luxuries before all children have lifesaving treatment is wrong
    - Discharge that debt by donating 10% of your income
  - The rationality community
    - No one is fully rational all the time
    - Discharge debt by improving your own personal rationality and donating to high-level rationalists
- Setting up unreasonably high standards has the following effects:
  - Hypocrisy: no one follows the standard all the time, and the standard is enforced inconsistently, often against the most vulnerable members of the community
  - Self-violence: unreasonably high standards force people's minds to turn against themselves, and result in self-hatred
  - Distorted perception and cognition leading to motivation problems: the righteous part of the mind sometimes has trouble looking at ways a person is failing to meet a standard, and that leads to motivation issues
  - Fear: accumulating debt gives one the feeling that one can be called to account and asked to do anything, at any time
- Systems with unreasonably high standards could be justified if they were good coordination mechanisms, but there's no evidence that unreasonably high standards form a better basis for coordination than existing defacto norms
- Unreasonably high standards are responsible for a great deal of violence and epistemic problems
- We have to distinguish unreasonably high standards from preference ordering
- Advice to the scrupulous: unreasonably high standards are a scam, and you are giving your life away to the scammers
