# [Mundane Magic](http://lesswrong.com/lw/ve/mundane_magic/)
- Part of the rationalist ethos is to bring yourself to believe *emotionally* in an absolutely lawful, reductionist universe
- Instead of looking for supernatural magic, try to see the magic and wonder in existing reality
- Rationality is the "ultimate power", allowing one to "see the future" and "manipulate probability"

# [Scarcity](http://lesswrong.com/lw/oz/scarcity/)
- Scarcity is a term in social psychology that makes things more desirable as they become more difficult to obtain
- People desire things more when they're forbidden from having them
- Information is subject to this effect - people become more sympathetic towards a particular viewpoint when they hear that it's been banned
- This is due to *psychological reactance* - people tend to try even harder to do something when you tell them that they can't do it
- This reflex may have served us well in the ancestral environment but it's easily taken advantage of in modern society
- The problem with desiring the unattainable is that the moment you get it, it's no longer unattainable

# [Angry Atoms](http://lesswrong.com/lw/p3/angry_atoms/)
- Our ordinary experience is far removed from the fundamental level of atoms and fundamental physical forces
- How can we explain emotion and free-will when we're composed of deterministic atoms?
- The key is to visualize how collections of atoms can be turned into decision-making components, and how those components can be combined to execute particular algorithms
- This is a huge inferential gap, but it can be crossed if you accept what science is telling you and remain skeptical about trusting your perspective/intuition

# [Heat vs. Motion](http://lesswrong.com/lw/p4/heat_vs_motion/)
- Another example of a huge inferential gap is the notion of heat
- Today we understand that heat and kinetic energy are the same thing, this is not an obviously true fact about the world
- People modeled heat and motion as two separate things, and this confused them into thinking that heat and motion were two separate entities in the world
- It took a major leap of insight to understand that heat and motion were the same thing, even though they appeared in two apparently separate guises
- Reductionism is easy, but actually reducing the world into its fundamental components is enormously difficult

# [A Priori](http://lesswrong.com/lw/k2/a_priori/)
- The notion of *a priori* truths or beliefs is a dodge - in a deterministic, reductionist universe, everything has to have a cause
- There is no such thing as an "arbitrary" belief in this universe - there are no gods to imbue these beliefs through divine inspiration
- The reason a Bayesian rationalist accepts Occam's Razor is not because of an a priori belief that simpler theories are true, but because simpler theories do a better job of explaining the universe
- Look at rationality as a machine rather than an argument - whatever makes the machine generate correct predictions about the world is rational
