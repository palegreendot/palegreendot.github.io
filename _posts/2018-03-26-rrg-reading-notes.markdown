## [Who Worships An Evil God?](https://exploringegregores.wordpress.com/who-worships-an-evil-god-2/)
* One of the most alluring themes in HP Lovecraft's mythos is the concept of "knowledge that drives you insane"
* People often think of this as creepy mind-control magic, but indoctrination is a more apt analogy
    * People who read "red-pill" forums and see everything in terms of sexuality and sexual conquest
    * People who become heavily influenced by gender studies and start seeing everything in terms of intersectional oppression
* People in the rationalist community have deified abstract forces like [Moloch](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/) or [Ra](https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2016/10/20/ra/)
* While Moloch and Ra are impersonal forces, we can explore what happens when people give themselves over entirely to these sorts of impersonal forces 
* Each Lovecraftian being can be seen as the symbol of a "mind-consuming belief" - a belief that is so powerful it can completely redefine your values

## [Cthuga, The Living Flame](https://exploringegregores.wordpress.com/2017/07/20/cthugha-the-living-flame/)
* Being of fire, imprisoned in a star
* Worshipped by people who believe that there is an essence that makes each person who they are, and as long as that essence is preserved, the person is preserved
* This is the god of the anti-deathism movement
* People who believe in uploading are especially strongly aligned with Cthuga
* People aligned with Cthuga want to meet other people as minds, not bodies - intensely extraverted in online spaces while being introverted in reality
* Cthuga views people as a collection of memes and masks - the space most aligned with Cthuga today would be 4Chan

## [Yog Sothoth, The Lurker At The Threshold](https://exploringegregores.wordpress.com/2017/08/01/yog-sothoth-the-lurker-at-the-threshold/)
* Yog Sothoth is an endless mass of glowing orbs, eyes, and tendrils
* The egregore representing natural laws
* Represents the miracle of "fine tuning" (i.e. that the fundamental constants of the universe are precisely those that allow intelligent life to develop)
* Yog Sothoth is the promise that mysteries of the universe can be known
* People strongly interested in understanding the world for the sake of understanding itself are aligned with Yog Sothoth

## [Hastur, The Unspeakable](https://exploringegregores.wordpress.com/2017/08/02/hastur-the-unspeakable/)
* Hastur is the god of Grand Narratives
* Manifests as a character in a play: *The King In Yellow*
* Symbol of stories that are more important than reality
* People aligned with Hastur are those who wish their lives would be part of some kind of epic story
* Hastur's promise is that your life can have the same level of epic meaning as that of the protagonist in a story

## [Ithaqua, The Wind Walker](https://exploringegregores.wordpress.com/2017/08/03/ithaqua-the-wind-walker/)
* Ithaqua is the egregore of isolation and introspection
* It is the spirit of self-expression, of doing your own thing not because society approves of it or it brings you some practical benefit, but because it is the thing you want to do
* Ithaqua and Cthuga oppose each other - Cthuga values community and communication, whereas Ithaqua values isolation and introspection
* Ithaqua pushes for having one or two very strong connections, whereas Cthuga pushes for many weak connections
* Those aligned with Ithaqua value personal autonomy above all else

## [Cthulhu Lies Dreaming](https://exploringegregores.wordpress.com/2017/08/04/cthulhu-lies-dreaming/)
* Cthulhu is by far the most famous of the egregores
* Cthulhu's worshippers have faith that their god will one day awaken and set them over the rest of the world
* This closely corresponds to the faith in the eventual victory of one's tribe or nation in tribalism and nationalism
* The notion of a "silent majority" supporting your position is very closely aligned with the notion of a sleeping Cthulhu
* Cthulhu is the egregore of sentimentality, chauvinism, and "my country right or wrong"

## [Shub Niggurath, The Black Goat of the Woods With A Thousand Young](https://exploringegregores.wordpress.com/2017/08/07/shub-niggurath-the-black-goat-of-the-woods-with-a-thousand-young/)
* Shub Niggurath is the egregore of "animalistic" drives
* Not just lust and hunger, but also mercy and compassion
* People aligned with Shub Niggurath see the civilization as a thin veneer over people's primal drives
* People who want to destroy civilization and return to a more "pure" state of nature are aligned with Shub Niggurath
* This includes both eco-terrorists and people who idolize Tyler Durden

## [Nyarlythotep, The Crawling Chaos](https://exploringegregores.wordpress.com/2017/08/08/nyarlythotep-the-crawling-chaos/)
* Nyarlythotep is the egregore of manipulation
* Not just book-smart like Yog Sothoth, but clever - can make people pay attention to them and convince them with words
* People aligned with Nyarlythotep value "elegant" social engineering of "crude" brute force
* Values manipulation for its own sake, because it's fun and challenging

## [Azathoth, The Nuclear Chaos](https://exploringegregores.wordpress.com/2017/08/09/azathoth-the-nuclear-chaos/)
* Worst and most powerful entity of the Lovecraft mythos
* Knowledge that everything is an approximation, and thus, a lie
* People aligned with Azathoth are people who've been let down by models
* People who insist on dealing with the full complexity of the world, even when working with simplified models would make them happier or more effective
* Azathoth is also the knowledge that the world is meaningless and that all attempts bring meaning are convenient lies we tell ourselves
* Devotees of Azathoth are active nihilists, in that the deliberately oppose any attempts to impose meaning on the world or on natural processes

## [Epilogue: Tsathoggua](https://exploringegregores.wordpress.com/2017/08/10/epilogue-tsathoggua/)
* Tsathoggua is the last and least threatening of egregores
* Represents the spirit of not caring
* Ultimate disaffected hipster
* While all the other egregores have serious, intense worldviews, Tsathoggua sits back and uses its wit and irony to make fun of them
* Charming in small doses and addictive in large doses
* Tsathoggua and Azathoth are both nihilist egregores, but while Azathoth is an active nihilist, Tsathoggua is a passive nihilist
* Tsathoggua will make fun of you for trying to introduce meaning, but won't try to stop you, unlike Azathoth
