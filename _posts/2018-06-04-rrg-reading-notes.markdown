## [My Kind of Reflection](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/TynBiYt6zg42StRbb/my-kind-of-reflection)
* When Eliezer is talking about ethics, he's talking about ethics as implemented in an AI system
* Reflective consistency is not necessarily a good end goal for a system of epistemics
    * 5 maps of a real city will all be consistent with one another
    * 5 maps of fictional city can also be consistent with one another
* Distinguish between the "defensive" posture that you use to justify your approach to others and the "aggressive" posture that you use to get as close to the truth as possible
* When you examine the foundations of your beliefs, you should improve them
* However, your improved foundations should still result in "normality" - you should still be able to explain everything that you've observed until now with your new foundations
* Distinguish between "Why does it work," and "Does it work?"
* Worry about making your philosophy correct before you worry about making it interesting
* Going through a loop of justifications in meta-reasoning isn't the same as circular logic

## [The Genetic Fallacy](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/KZLa74SzyKhSJ3M55/the-genetic-fallacy)
* The genetic fallacy is the fallacy of attacking a belief because of the reason that someone holds the belief
* However, knowing the reason that someone holds a belief can give us evidence as to whether we should update towards that belief or not
* The genetic fallacy is a fallacy because the reason that someone holds the belief may not be the best justification for the belief - the belief may be sound, even though the reasoning is silly
* This fallacy is much less of a fallacy among actual humans than it is among ideal Bayesians
    * People change their minds much less often than they think
    * If you realize that one of your sources is flawed, then you have to forcibly clear your mind of all the beliefs that were supported by that source
    * This is *very* difficult
    * You should be extremely suspicious of ideas that came from a flawed source but still ended up being correct
* On the other hand, once you have empirical evidence for or against a belief, it doesn't matter where the belief came from
    * Ex: Once you have experimental evidence for the structure of benzene, it doesn't matter that Kekule originally saw the structure in a dream
* In the absence of clear-cut experimental evidence, you need to take into account the trustworthiness of your source
* Good rules of thumb
    * Be wary of leveling genetic accusations against ideas that you dislike
    * Once there's experimental evidence on the table, it gets priority - you can no longer resort to criticizing the idea based upon the original reasoning for it

## [Fundamental Doubts](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/9EahWKqay6HZcaNTY/fundamental-doubts)
* Because humans are not perfect Bayesians, the genetic fallacy is not entirely a fallacy
* When suspicion is cast upon one of your sources, you must immediately cast doubt upon all of the conclusions you have drawn from the source
* This is one of the most difficult techniques in all of rationality
* However, there are some things you can't doubt, things which are built into your mental hardware
* We must do the best we can, with the brains we have
* By learning about and recognizing the flaws in our cognition, we can work around them to some extent

## [Rebelling Within Nature](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/YhNGY6ypoNbLJvDBu/rebelling-within-nature)
* You can rebel against a *facet* of nature, but your rebellion is still within nature as a whole
* You and your brain are a result of nature; everything you do is a result of some natural force
* You can't escape the processes that made your mind the way it is - there's no way to turn your brain into the empty mind of an ideal philosopher
* So, what can we do?
* Even though we can't escape the fact that we are a result of evolution, we can question it
* The fact that something was designed by evolution is not a sufficient reason to reject it
* Judge emotions for what they are, not as the result of an evolutionary process
* Use the full power of your morality and your rationality, without worrying that it has been somehow tainted by being a product of evolution

## [Probability Is Subjectively Objective](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/XhaKvQyHzeXdNnFKy/probability-is-subjectively-objective)
* E.T. Jaynes described himself as a "subejctive-objective" Bayesian - probabilities exist in our minds, but that doesn't mean we can use whatever priors we want
* How can something be "objective", but still exist only in our minds?
* If you can change it by thinking differently, it's subjective; if it remains the same no matter how you think of it, it's objective
* Even though every thought you take takes place within your brain, not every thought you have is about your brain
* So is probability subjective or objective?
* We assign probability distributions to events, but we only see individual events, not the probability distribution
* The uncertainty about an event that causes us to assign a probability to it resides in our minds, not in the world
* Jaynes recommends that we never use unconditional probabilities - every probability is conditional upon our background priors
* This reinforces the point that probabilities only exist in minds - there is no such thing as a truly unconditional probability
* But, just because priors reside in our mind, it doesn't mean that all priors are equally good
* Changing your beliefs about probabilities by editing your brain doesn't actually change whether that event will occur in the world
