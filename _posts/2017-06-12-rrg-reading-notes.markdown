## [The Art of Response](http://mindingourway.com/the-art-of-response/)
* Imagine two people faced with solving a problem
* Alice approaches the problem methodically, decomposing or simplifying the problem before coming up with a solution
* Bob panics, and in panicking, drops into a loop where his distress causes him to focus on his distress, which further prevents him from solving the problem
* So why do some people approach problems analytically, while others panic?
  * Is it just experience? Maybe Alice has encountered the problem, or similar problems before
  * Self-confidence also plays a part: if Alice is more self-confident than Bob, then she will do better at solving the problem, even if she and Bob have the same level of experience
  * Finally, consider response patterns:
    * Bob sits waiting for a solution to present itself
    * Alice actively engages with the problem, and tries to simplify it or break it down into subproblems
* Looking at Alice and Bob, we can say that Alice is more confident than Bob, but that doesn't tell us how or why confidence works
* We can readily imagine that Alice (and Bob) responding in their characteristic manners to a variety of situations
* The goal of developing appropriate response patterns is to avoid flailing or staring blankly
* The reflex of blanking your mind and waiting for a solution to be delivered isn't a very effective strategy
* Effective response patterns are about solving the problem well, not solving it quickly
  * Jumping in without taking time to understand the problem often results in you solving the wrong problem
* The most confident people are people who have effective response patterns
* Developing effective response patterns in an area takes much less practice and knowledge than developing true expertise
* Having an explicit checklist of things to do can be helpful in avoiding panic and ineffective response patterns
* People can benefit from having "fallback" response patterns for handling new or surprising events

## [Why Books Are Fake](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/06/01/why-books-are-fake/)
* Every citation is either a homework assignment or a promise
  * Either *assigns* the reader work to fill in background knowledge or *promises* that the cited material is accurate
* Every book also has *implicit citations* - the assumed background knowledge that's shared between the author and the reader
* Books are not separable units of wisdom, even though they're presented as such by society
* Books are inseparably tied to their historical contexts
* Interestingness is not a fixed property of a work, but a measure of whether that work can move from shared common knowledge to surprising new information
* Books are only interesting if you have the common knowledge the author assumes you have
* People consumed books vastly differently before the Internet
  * Prior to the Internet, your entire interaction with the book consisted of you reading it
  * The only real way to respond to a book was to write your own book and get it published
* Now books are more used as source material for conversations on the Internet than being the loci of conversations themselves
* The three types of canon
  * In an oral culture, people could hold their entire cultural canon in their heads
  * With the advent of printing, the canon starts fragmenting
    * Divide between "high" and "popular" culture
    * Literary genres
  * Finally with the spread of information technology, the entire concept of a shared canon goes away, and all you have is the canon that's specific to the subcultures you belong to
* Even though we no longer have a shared canon across all of society, we still want one - the spread of viral media is the result of people's attempts to forge a new shared canon
* Permanent liminality
  * Liminality - the state of being between states
  * A liminal space is a space that connects two "real" spaces
  * Behavioral scripts are relaxed and altered in liminal spaces and times
  * Dreams are a stereotypical liminal space
  * Permanent liminality is a situation in which liminality is activated and never deactivated
  * Temporary deviations from the normal become permanent without any social acknowledgement that they've become permanent
  * "Common knowledge" shifts and never shifts back
* At this point, we should see liminality as the rule rather than the exception
  * In a situation of constant liminality, people start to see patterns in the change
  * Even though people are subjec to constant change at the object level, they draw meta-level similarities to create a non-liminal meta-space

## [Class Has Normative Power](https://bambamramfan.tumblr.com/post/154054812092/class-has-normative-power)
* There is a distinction between social and economic class
  * Economic class: how much money you make
  * Social class: social status (how much you're trusted by strangers)
  * While each type of class can be parlayed into the other type, doing so requires a conscious choice
  * In the US, there's a lot of pressure to conflate social and economic class
  * Discussing economic class is fine; discussing social class is taboo
  * Social classes are cultures
* The problem with most rationalists' distinction between social and economic class is that it risks obscuring the fact that different social classes are not co-equal tribes
* We think of high-class things as good because they're high class
* Class amplifies capitalism into psychological terror: "it is your fault that you're poor"
* Completely eliminating class is a moral goal
* Everyone (even those at the top of the class hierarchy) is affected by the tyranny of class
* There isn't a single, global class hierarchy - class hierarchies are fractal
* Racism can be explained as the automatic conflation of race with class, putting people those of certain races into lower classes while ignoring other class signifiers
* The success of ideological movements comes down to how well they can make their values into upper-class values
* However, there are two big risks with turning your movement into a class signifier
  * Class signifiers tend to be more about symbolism than results
  * Backlash - people of other classes will deliberately work against your movement

## [Stop Hacking Your Life](http://www.artofmanliness.com/2015/04/13/stop-hacking-your-life/)
* Remember your true goals
* Accumulating lifehacks for the sake of accumulating lifehacks is pointless
* Lifehacks stigmatize effort
  * Lifehacks prioritize efficiency over results
  * Means that high-effort goals are implicitly considered less valuable
* Lifehacks undervalue the obvious and useful for the new and ineffectual
  * Lifehacks are easier to fund and promote than actually good advice
* Lifehacks lead to aimless optimization
  * The best way to become more productive is to have a set of definite goals
  * The goal will naturally provide the metrics by which you judge optimizations and will prevent you from spending effort on optimizations that don't enhance your ability to reach the goal
* Lifehacks distort our view of time
  * Lifehacks focus on short term immediate optimizations
  * Risk getting us stuck in local maxima
* Lifehacks, paradoxically, lead to procrastination
  * Lifehacks often suggest a definite or optimal starting point
  * This often induces people who are not at that particular starting point to put off working on their goals
  * But the important thing is to start working, even if conditions aren't optimal
* Lifehacks favor irrational rationality
  * Irrational rationality: being reasonable at an unreasonable time
  * Rational irrationality: being unreasonable at the right times
  * Do what works, even when other people think it's stupid
* What's the point, what is there to do?
  * Lifehacks weaken self-reliance
  * Lifehacks are tactics, not strategy

## [Should Non-experts Shut Up - The Skeptic's Catch-22](http://rationallyspeaking.blogspot.com/2010/07/should-non-experts-shut-up-skeptics_14.html)
* While non-experts can rely on experts to judge the validity of research within a field, they cannot rely on those experts to judge the validity of the field itself
* Catch-22: the only people who are in a position to question the foundational assumptions of a field (experts) are those with the strongest incentives to not do so
* So how do we deal with the problem?
  * Find people familiar with the methodology of the field but not of the field itself
  * Look for testable predictions and a track record of predicting correctly
