## [Hot Allostatic Load](https://thenewinquiry.com/hot-allostatic-load/)
* For years, queer/trans/feminist scenes have been processing an influx of trans fems, often disabled, from traumatic backgrounds
* These scenes have been exploiting these traumatized trans fems, and using them as a source of cheap labor
* If the trans fem in question complains, she is cut off from social support, and is labeled "problematic", ruining her reputation
* This cycle of exploitation occurs because trans fems are uniquely vulnerable to abuse
  * Many of them are encountering trans concepts for the first time, and have no idea what is and isn't normal
  * Many of them have nowhere else to go besides these communities
  * Few care what happens to trans fems
* This cycle relies on amnesia
  * Many of the new entrants to these spaces don't know or understand the space's history
  * Spaces self-select for people who will prioritize the space over reporting or calling out abuse that people suffer in that space
  * This drains empathetic people from the space, and all who remain are those who identify solely with the agendas and survival of the space
* Allied Media Conference 2013
  * People from Porpentine's community saw her asking about community resources in Oakland
  * Interpreted that as an intent to move away from current (abusive) community
  * This prompted the community to bombard her with abusive messages on Twitter and socially isolate her
  * In an atypical move, the conference noticed this and offered to have her back next year to host a workshop -- most spaces are not this accommodating
* Abusive spaces seed rumors ahead of time, creating a "brittle structure" around trans people that may be shattered at any time to create social isolation

### Attack
* Porpentine was nominated to receive an award at the Indicade festival
* A cis person nominated for that award would have been able to just receive the award
* However, when the award was presented to a trans person, the community united against her
  * Spread rumors that she was sending harassing messages
  * Rumors were spread without warning, and without any attempt at reconciliation
  * Allies were unwilling to defend Porpentine, because they were afraid of becoming targets themselves
* Social media and health
  * For a disabled trans person barred from many physical spaces, social media is an important outlet
  * However, social media has its own set of problems
    * Pressure not to post about certain things that were important to her but were deemed problematic by the community
    * Pressure to voice public support for things that she didn't care about or actively disliked
    * Accusations of hidden messages or dogwhistles in otherwise innocent content
  * The feminist practice of declaring privilege and marginalization became a way to collect information about her for use later

### Mobbing
* Call-out culture as ritual disposability
  * Feminist/queer spaces are more willing to criticize individuals than systems
  * Want the right to use systems for their own ends
  * When Porpentine curated games, she was pressured not to cover a game made by a trans woman
  * She covered the game anyway, and made herself a target
  * What can we learn from this?
    * Lofty, high-minded processes are cover for petty squabbles
    * People have to be made disposable on a regular basis in order to maintain the ritual purity of the space
    * People who deserve the effects of call-out culture can shrug off the effects, while those who are weak are affected by the normalization of violence that call-out culture creates
    * Punishment is not something that happens to bad people, punishment is something that happens to people who cannot stop it from happening
* Mobbing
  * Common tool of exclusion
  * Emotional abuse practiced by a group of peers over a period of time
    * Gaslighting
    * Rumor-mongering
    * Ostracism
  * Rarely talked about because it's difficult to pin the blame on a single person
  * Why is mobbing so damaging
    * Damages a victim's relationship to society -- can't explain away the actions of a mob as the behavior of a single aberrant individual
    * Ostracism causes insidious damage - victim isn't visibly targeted or damaged in anyway, but rather is starved of resources and attention until they go away
    * Occurs in a place where the victim often is forced to attend, either by need or obligation
      * Schools
      * Workplaces
      * Circles of friends
  * The damage caused by mobbing is often exacerbated by the fact that the people being mobbed are true believers of the ideology of the space
  * People who participate in mobs invest in a narrative of their victims being monsters in order to protect their own self-conception
* Mobbing as witch hunts
  * Witch hunts were responses to capital accumulation
    * The purpose of a witch hunt was to keep (fem, non-white) labor in line
    * The effect of a witch hunt is to devalue the labor of marginalized people and destroy their bonds with one another
  * Mobbing goes all the way down
    * Victims of mobs are perfectly capable of participating in mobs
    * Mobbing creates a hierarchy of labor and competition
* Sexual menace
  * Accusations of sexual menace are a key weapon used against marginalized people in feminist spaces
  * These accusations create a mechanism for dominant people to keep marginalized people under control

### Damage
* PTSD as disposability alchemy
  * Allostatic load on a person is the damage they suffer due to repeated exposures to chronic stress
  * Constant exposure to negative feedback gave Porpentine PTSD, which, combined with the effects of gender transition, caused ongoing physical health issues in addition to mental health problems
  * People with PTSD need more than jobs, they need social reintegration

### Communication
* Inability to share stigma
  * The presence of others who went through the same process of ostracization, but were eventually reintegrated, is a source of worry, not comfort
  * Why were those people worth saving?
* Inadmissible narratives of abuse #1
  * The most skilled abusers know that exile is best accomplished with silence
  * Use backchannels and whisper networks to turn the community against the victim
  * Weaponize the tools that the community uses to protect itself
  * Make it so that it's hard for the victim to even get a straight answer about what's going on
* Inadmissible narratives of abuse #2
  * When verbal abuse does occur, it's often cloaked in the language of feminism
  * It's easy to refute misogynistic language hurled against women
  * It's far more difficult to refute feminist-coded insults hurled against trans women
  * Even attempting to refute the accusations implies that there is something to refute
* Trash art
  * Laziness is a symptom, not a cause
  * Can be a symptom of:
    * Avoidance of one's own body
    * Avoidance of triggers
    * Avoidance of the future or thoughts of the future

### Social Dynamics
* Community is disposability
  * Everything in this world has a community, no matter how varied or fragmented the reality
  * These idealized communities require disposability to maintain their purity
  * This disposability takes the form of radical hate -- hate that has a moral dimension
* Curating queerness
  * An entire industry of curation has sprung up to police who can and cannot express themselves as a trans person
  * Industry defines what is and is not a "valid" trans narrative
  * Stories that reflect poorly on queer and alt culture are buried in favor of stories that tout a utopianism that many aspire to but few live
* Complaint and purity
  * Popular feminism requires one to engage in a constant cycle of complaint
  * Those with external sources of resources and energy can keep up this cycle
  * However, those who are most vulnerable are filtered out, because they cannot keep up with the latest outrage
  * Repressive forces don't stop people from expressing themselves, but rather force people to express themselves, even when doing so would cause them harm

### Conclusion
* Ending
  * Nothing is too bad, too ridiculous, too bizarre when it comes to making marginalized people disappear
  * Ideology is a sick fetish
* Resisting disposability
  * Let marginalized people be flawed
  * Resist "criminal justice" thinking
    * Trial by mob favors predators
    * Justice is not hundreds of people ganging up on a lone individual
  * Pay attention when people disappear from communities
  * Even if the victim doesn't want to fight, show them private support
    * Just knowing that there are others out there with dissenting opinions can make a huge difference
  * Be extremely critical about what people say about trans people
    * The rumor mill that marginalizes trans people does not require disinterested third parties to believe the rumors
    * It only requires that they take the "safe" choice
  * Ask yourself if the same thing would be happening if the person were white/cis/able-bodied
  * Marginalized spaces can't form a healthy community solely by rejecting the mainstream -- having a common enemy isn't the same thing as loving each other
  * Don't be part of spaces that place an ideal or "community leader" above people
