## [Why Your Brain Hates Other People](http://nautil.us/issue/49/the-absurd/why-your-brain-hates-other-people)
* The strength of us vs. them
  * Dividing the world into Us and Them is deeply hardwired into our brains
  * Not just a human characteristic - other primates make similar distinctions
  * Us vs. them characterizations can be made extremely quickly (50ms)
* The nature of Us
  * People who comprise the ingroup are seen as more wise, more moral, more worthy, etc.
  * Being a member of an ingroup carries with it moral obligations to help other members of the ingroup
  * Seeing outgroup members lose appears to activate the same dopamine pathways as seeing ingroup members win
* The nature of Them
  * The initial feeling that characterizes the outgroup as bad is pre-rational
  * Rational cognitions about outgroups can be emotionally and subconsciously manipulated
    * Emotions about foreign countries can be manipulated by subliminally flashing images of fearful people
    * Activating disgust (by making people sit near smelly garbage) makes them more socially conservative
    * Women are more hostile to outgroup men when they're ovulating
    * Even a small visible reminder of the existence of the outgroup can make members of the ingroup more hostile
* The Heterogeneity of Them
  * Our brains treat different outgroups differently
  * Anger, disgust, and ridicule are all emotions that we feel towards outgroups
  * Not every outgroup triggers all three emotions
* Cold and/or incompetent
  * We classify outgroups along two axes: emotional warmth and competence
  * Warmth: is the individual or group benevolent or malevolent
  * Competence: is the individual or group competent at carrying out their objectives
  * The axes can be primed independently
  * Each combination of warmth and competence produces different emotions
    * High warmth/high competence: ingroup pride
    * Low warmth/high competence: envy/resentment
    * High warmth/low competence: pity
    * Low warmth/low competence: disgust
  * Outgroup categorizations aren't static, and the most interesting reactions occur when people see an outgroup move from one category to another
    * High warmth/high competence to high warmth/low competence: protectiveness
    * High warmth/high competence to low warmth/high competence: betrayal
    * High warmth/high competence to low warmth/low competnece: disgust and bafflement
    * Low warmth/low competence to low warmth/high competence: fear
    * Low warmth/low competence to high warmth/low competence: (temporary) acknowledgement
    * Low warmth/high competence to low warmth/low competence: gleeful gloating - most efforts of genocide/ethnic cleansing start by turning a low warmth/high competence outgroup into a low warmth/low competence one
* Multiple Us-es
  * We constantly shift which category we consider most relevant when considering ingroup/outgroup distinctions
  * Racial classifications can be overridden by other group affiliations
  * Looking for a particular feature or characteristic seesm to prevent us from making ingroup/outgroup distinctions as quickly
  * Rapid recategorizations can occur even in times of great stress (i.e. war)
    * Masonic symbols can trump Union/Confederate distinctions in the Civil War
    * WW 1 "Christmas Truce"
    * Knowledge of classics brought together British and German officers in World War 2
* Lessening the Impact of Us/Them-ing
  * Contact - needs to be done carefully, can make ingroup/outgroup distinctions worse if done poorly
  * Approach the implicit - show people their biases and they're more likely to override their implicit ingroup/outgroup considerations
  * Replace essentialism with individuation
  * Flatten hierarchies

## [Lying On The Ground](https://mindlevelup.wordpress.com/2017/07/29/lying-on-the-ground/)
* Saturation
  * People have trouble maintaining the same activity for hours at a time
  * This is true of even "fun" activities like Netflix or video games
  * The problem with getting off-schedule is less about not doing work as it is about getting sucked into dark spirals that waste time
  * Doing things that aren't work but are ways of resetting are valuable for breaking those spirals
* Cultivating Feeling
  * Feeling is a loose label used for the category of things that involve getting in touch with your body's sensations
  * How can we be more generative and synthesize existing information by putting in mental effort?
* Really boring activities, like lying on the ground can help reset hedonic treadmills so that even relatively unpleasant work becomes not so unpleasant
* A lot of the reason various unhealthy behaviors hare compelling is because they have variable rewards

## [What Do We Really Want](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/what-do-we-really-want)
* People's desired attitudes affect behavior more than their real attitudes
* People are likely to seek out information that confirms their desired attitude
* When presented with flawed evidence for or against their desired attitude, people are more likely to accept the evidence that favors their desired attitude
* People are willing to change the objects of their desired attitude in order to make those objects easier to like (i.e. adding cream and sugar to coffee)
* However, there are limits - at some point we can't force ourselves to like something that we wish we'd like

## [How Social Is Reason](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2017/08/how-social-is-reason.html)
* Humans, and only humans perform abstract reasoning
* But what is the evolutionary reason for humans to have this ability?
* Many argue that abstract reasoning improves individual cognitive performance, thus allowing individuals that have it to better adapt
* However, Mercier and Sperber argue that the primary purpose of reason is persuasion
* Logic exists because it's effective at getting other people to agree with the person using logic

## [Ems Evolve](http://www.bayesianinvestor.com/blog/index.php/2017/07/28/ems-evolve/)
* Bostrom worries about the future as being like "Disneyland Without Children"
* The future might be populated by many agents, but all of whom lack some defining characteristic *X*, which makes us human
* While this is mainly seen as a concern for a future with ems, this is also a concern with biological evolution (on a longer timescale)
* Two scenarios in which *X* is lost
  * Case A: single step in which *X* is lost
    * Maybe *X* is inherently unobservable, so we don't know we have to preserve it
    * Maybe people only care about *X* when they're thinking abstractly, so they don't take actions to preserve it
    * Both of these can be fixed by conducting research into what makes us human, and then ensuring that those parts are preserved in any uploading technology
  * Case B: *X* is slowly eroded over a long period of time
    * Can we coordinate to ensure that no one starts down the slippery slope of losing their humanity?
      * Humanity coordinated to ban CFCs and stop acid rain
      * Global coordination has been significantly less successful at stopping global warming or preventing nuclear proliferation
      * Success requires widespread agreement on what *X* is, plus easy and cheap detection and enforcement
      * With ems, detecting violations will be difficult, as an em with slightly less *X* will behave almost identically to an em with 100% *X*
        * Will need to be able to inspect virtually all software
      * Maybe we can limit ems with reduced *X* to a limited portion of the population (much like we handle crime in today's society)
    * Failure scenarios
      * Dispute over what *X* is and whether it should be preserved
      * If even a small number of ems don't have *X*, it's possible for them to outreproduce a larger initial population of ems that do have *X*
      * Everyone values *X*, but *X*-less ems are used for labor
        * Less of a concern with UBI that ensures that people have a decent life even if they don't perform labor
      * All work/no fun
        * End up sacrificing *X* to ensure that our descendants will be a significant fraction of the future population
        * Doesn't seem like a very urgent failure mode
        * Instructions for fun appear to be small in comparison to the instructions for intelligence
        * Relatively low cost of preserving fun makes it more likely that there will be a global agreement to preserve fun
* How urgent is it?
  * Do we need to implement a program to find and preserve the essential characteristics of humanity?
  * If *X* is lost as a result of uploading, we do, but it is unlikely that initial uploads will lose *X*
* Enforcement
  * The age of ems can be postponed by banning uploads
  * However, the first uploads will probably be recognizably human, so this isn't a good reason to oppose uploading
