## Reading Notes

### [The Great Filter - Are We Almost Past It? Robin Hanson](http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/greatfilter.html)
* Fermi Paradox - by the [Drake Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation), life should be abundant in the universe
  * There are lots of stars
  * Many of those stars are sun-like
  * There are lots of planets
  * Many of those planets are presumably earthlike (even though we can't detect them yet)
  * So where is everyone? Why have we not discovered any form of life outside of Earth?
  * More to the point, why hasn't an extraterrestrial civilization colonized Earth? 
  * If interstellar travel is possible (even at slow sublight speeds), there's still plenty of room in geological timescales for interstellar civilization to spread
* The Fermi Paradox must force us to revise one or more of our standard views in biology, astronomy, physics or the social sciences
* These revisions suggest that humanity ought to be much more wary of future disasters
* Life will colonize
  * So far, on Earth, life has evolved to fill every viable ecological niche that it can find
  * Newly opened frontiers don't stay sterile for long
  * Life seems to have a "dispersal phase", and sexual mixing and mutations encourage exploration of new "technologies"
  * Moreover, humanity, overall has expanded to fill geographic and economic niches
    * Even when a particular human civilization fails to expand, other civilizations expand to fill in the gap
  * Thus we should expect when interstellar space travel is possible, some of our descendants will try to colonize the other planets in the solar system, and then other stars
  * We should expect this as long as society allows certain members to have and act on alternative views
  * A million years is a cosmologically short time scale, yet even very low rates of population growth will overwhelm the fundamental limits of negentropy in that time
  * Evolutionary pressure should encourage a maximum economically feasible growth rate, as those who do not explore are outcompeted by those who do, and discover fresh resources
* The Data Point
  * There is at least a 1/1000 chance over the next ten million years that humanity's descendants will reach an "explosive point" where human civilization expands outwards at near light-speed
  * This explosion will fill most every available niche containing usable resources
  * Moreover, this explosion would be detectable - colonization would disturb the natural state of of the place that it colonizes
  * If advanced life forms had colonized our planet, we would have known by now
  * If advanced life forms had restructured our solar system, we would have known by now
  * If advanced life forms had left the Sun alone (nature preserve theory), but had colonized nearby stars, we would have known by now
  * But our local stellar neighborhood doesn't look like it's been colonized
  * This suggests that no prior civilization has reached the "explosive point" and started expanding rapidly
* The Great Filter
  * Best guess evolutionary path to an explosion that leads to colonization of the visible universe:
    # Right star system
    # Self-reproducing molecules (RNA, DNA, or something similiar)
    # Simple (e.g. prokaryotic) life
    # Complex (e.g. eukaryotic) life
    # Sexual reproduction
    # Multi-cellular life
    # Tool-using animals
    # Current human civilization
    # Colonization explosion
  * The Great Silence implies that one or more of these steps are much more improbable than we have reason to believe
  * The fact that our universe isn't already full of life implies that it's very hard for life to arise
* Someone's story is wrong
  * Biologists have worked hard to show that evolutionary steps aren't especially improbable
  * Plausible models show how RNA turns into cellular life, how cellular life becomes more complicated, how intelligence evolves, and how intelligence leads to tool use and scenario generation
  * Similarly, technological optimists have taken standard economic trends and our understanding of evolutionary processes to show that if we can colonize the solar system, we can colonize the galaxy within a short period of time after that
  * Colonization of the solar system is already possible with current technology - the barriers are economic
  * However, the one data point described above - the fact that the universe has not already been colonized shows that at least one of the models described above is wrong
  * Life is either more rare than we think, or complex life is more rare than we think, or intelligence is more rare than we think, or it's a lot harder for species to escape their home planet/solar system than we think
* It Matters Who's Wrong
  * Is the Great Filter in our past (i.e. we've already passed through it and we have no further obstacles towards becoming a universe-spanning life form) or is it in our future, in which case we should worry?
  * If the Great Filter is in our future, we should seek out Filter scenarios and take steps to prevent or mitigate them
* Reconsidering Biology
  * Many biologists do expect a large filter between dead matter and intelligent tool using life
  * Complain that astronomers who estimate Drake Equation terms don't understand biology
  * Say that tool use has only arisen once in the fossil record (i.e. humans)
  * How do we evaluate this possibility?
    * Distinguish between "discrete" and "trial-and-error" evolutionary steps
    * Discrete steps have to succeed within a specific time window
    * Trial-and-error steps are search across a mostly flat fitness landscape - failure today doesn't affect the chances for success tomorrow
    * Main Great Filter implications all concern "trial-and-error" steps
    * "Hard step" candidates
      * Origin of life
      * Complex life (0-8 steps)
      * Sexual reproduction (2-3 steps)
      * Society (2 steps)
      * Cradle (1 step)
      * Possible language step (1 step)
    * Overall, 7-9 hard steps in biology
    * Step duration doesn't necessarily correspond to how difficult the step is - was the transition easier to surmount than expected, or was it a hard step that you got lucky on?
  * 2 more hard steps outside of biology
    * Getting the right sort of planet
    * Civilization destroying itself
  * Panspermia
    * If life originated outside the Solar System, then that would allow for many more trial-and-error steps to have taken place
    * Allows steps prior to single-celled life to be less probable, but makes up for it by allowing single-celled life to spread from place to place
  * SETI evidence
    * If SETI finds radio signals from extraterrestrial intelligences, then this would also help us pin down our biological expectations
    * Would actually be bad news - would indicate that Great Filter is in our future, since there are other species that have reached our level of technology but not spread
* Reconsidering Astrophysics
  * Fast space travel between stars and galaxies could be much more difficult than it looks
  * The universe might be smaller than it looks (unusual topology), which, in turn would imply that the universe is younger than it looks
  * It might be easy to create "baby universes" with unlimited mass and negentropy - the process for which prevents civilizations from expanding to colonize
  * Alternatively, maybe the universe is alive, but we just don't see it
    * Large scale engineering may be impossible, which would mean that civilizations could not affect the spectra of stars
    * Best use of stellar resources preserves the spectrum of a star
    * Advanced life colonizes "dark matter"
* Rethinking Social Theories
  * Humanity will either destroy itself or lose its propensity to expand
  * Galaxy is populated by "stable, ethical and spiritual civilizations"
  * Civilizations would have to follow this path with a nearly 100% reliability
  * From what we know of social science and history, this seems really really unlikely
  * More pessimistic social scenarios: 
    * Nuclear war: would have to take place prior to dispersal across Solar System
    * Ecological failure: would have to take place prior to humanity transcending biology either through machine intelligence or uploads
    * Social collapse
      * Easter Island (_though, wasn't that actually an ecological failure?_)
  * Zoo/common zoo theories
    * First expanding civilization had a strong preservationist intent
    * Preserved majority of space as "nature preserves"
    * However
      * Preservationist instinct would have to not affect the competitive viability of that initial civilization
      * Civilization would have to invest resources in preventing "poaching" (i.e. stopping other civilizations from colonizing under its nose)
* Conclusion
  * To support optimism about the future, we must find especially improbable past evolutionary steps
  * Possible hard evolutionary steps: life, complexity, sex, society, cradle and language
  * Great Filter can be explained if the expected time averaged logarithmically to 30 billion years for each of those steps
  * If only 1% of stars can support life, then with that expected value, we would expect no other life to have colonized the universe
  * We must be careful to avoid a "God of the Gaps" approach, where we say the Great Filter is whatever we haven't yet eliminated
  * Candidates for the Great Filter must have an exceedingly small probability of success
  * If we can't find the Great Filter in our past, we must fear it in our future

### [Where Are They - Why I Hope the Search for Extraterrestrial Life Finds Nothing - Nick Bostrom](http://www.nickbostrom.com/extraterrestrial.pdf)
* Bostrom hopes we find no life on Mars
* The more complex the life, the more pessimistic he is
* SETI has been going for ~50 years, and has come up with nothing
* We have every reason to believe (from exoplanet surveys) that our solar system is not distinguished, and that Earth isn't a special or rare planet
* So where is everyone? Why haven't we detected life? Why haven't we been visited by extraterrestrial life?
* There must be a Great Filter somewhere which prevents life from expanding
* This filter must be exceedingly powerful - out of billions and billions of germination points, not once does life expand past a single planet
* Where might this filter be located?
  * It's either in our past or in our future
  * Past
    * Some extremely improbable step in the sequence of events by which an Earth-like planet gives rise to intelligent life
    * Maybe we shouldn't take evolution of intelligence for granted?
    * Maybe we shouldn't take evolution of life for granted?
      * We have not successfully replicated abiogenesis in the lab
      * The emergence of life took hundreds of millions of years after the cooling of the Earth - points to abiogenesis being an enormously low probability event
    * Candidates for evolutionarily improbable events have to share the following criteria:
      * Has to have only occurred once - if it happened more than once, the probability is too high for it to be a Great Filter
      * Took a long time to occur even after its evolutionary prerequisites were in place - needed many local random recombinations, or several improbable mutations all occurring at the same time
    * Possibilities:
      * Original emergence of life
      * Prokaryote to eukaryote transition
      * Multi-cellular organisms
      * Sexual reproduction
  * Future:
    * There is some improbability that prevents almost all technological civilizations at our level of technology from progressing to the point where they engage in large-scale space colonization
    * It's highly probable that if there were interstellar life, we would have encountered it by now
      * Von Neumann Probes
      * Even traveling at 1% of the speed of light, Von Neumann probes can colonize the galaxy in 20 million years (relatively short by cosmological timescales)
      * Moreover, life on Earth exhibits a strong tendency to spread where-ever it can - we should expect the same for interstellar life
      * If going to space is cheap, we should expect civiliations to go to space - most resources are off-world
    * So why don't we see anyone out there?
      * Destructive tendencies common to virtually all technologically advanced civilizations
        * Even complete civilizational collapse that stops technological progress for hundreds of thousands of years at a time would not be enough to form a Great Filter
        * Any civilization-scale disaster would have to be a global cataclysm - X-Risk
          * Nuclear war fought with enormous stockpiles
          * Genetically engineered infection
          * Environmental disaster
          * Asteroid impact
          * Wars or terrorist acts committed with powerful superweapons
          * AGI with destructive goals
          * High-energy physics experiments
          * Permanent totalitarian regime protected by mind control and surveillance
        * For an X-Risk to be a Great Filter, it would have to apply to not just humanity, but virtually all civilizations and species capable of technology
          * For this reason, asteroid impacts and natural disasters are unlikely to be Great Filters - you'd have to posit that *all* civilizations would fall victim to these before being able to escape their homeworlds
          * The best candidate is a technological discovery - something that almost all civilizations discover, and something whose discovery leads almost certainly to disaster
* So what does all this have to do with finding life on Mars?
  * The more advanced life we find on Mars, the lower the probability that the Great Filter is in our past
  * Conversely, if we find that Mars had (has) all the ingredients for life, but no life, we can have greater confidence that the Great Filter is in our past - that Earth is past the Great Filter merely by virtue of developing life
  * Of course, there's nothing stating that there has to be only *one* Great Filter - the evolution of life might be exceedingly improbable, and it might be exceedingly difficult for species to escape their home planets

### [Don't Fear The Filter - Scott Alexander](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/28/dont-fear-the-filter/)
* The Great Filter is not garden-variety X-Risk: Great Filters have to kill of all or almost all civilizations, not just human civilizations
* The Great Filter is not unfriendly AI: if anything, UFAI would be *easier* to observe than a "normal" civilization
  * The best studied class of UFAI is paperclip maximizers
  * We haven't seen a sphere of the visible universe tuned to some optimal criteria, expanding at a significant fraction of the speed of light
* The Great Filter is not transcendence
  * It takes just one match to start a conflagration
  * It takes just one species to colonize a galaxy
  * Literally every species would have to turn into hippies in order for transcendence to be a viable Great Filter
* The Great Filter is not alien exterminators
  * If there is already a civilization out there, that we haven't detected, watching us, it already knows about Earth
  * We shouldn't worry about sending radio messages because the fact that Earth hasn't been scorched into a sterile ball of rock means that whoever is out there is okay with us, at some level
  * Moreover, if they've got a billion year head start on us, it means that they had space travel when Earth had... single celled micro-organisms -- there's no realistic way for us to threaten them
* So we shouldn't worry about the Great Filter because it's unlikely there's anything we can do about it
