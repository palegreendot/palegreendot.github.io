## [Tsuyoku Naritai! (I Want To Become Stronger)](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/DoLQN5ryZ9XkZjq5h/tsuyoku-naritai-i-want-to-become-stronger)
* The purpose of confessing your biases and flaws is to focus on fixing them
* There should be no pride gained by the mere confessing of flaws
* The important thing is to confess your flaws and then work on fixing them, a little bit at a time

## [Something To Protect](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/SGR4GxFK7KmW7ckCB/something-to-protect)
* Rationality is not an end in itself - it is a means to some other goal
* Rationalists must have something that they value more than rationality
* Rationality should be *useful*
* Science beat religion because it could produce better technology, not because it could produce more convincing explanations for natural phenomena
* The relationship between loving Truth and loving usefulness is complicated
    * If you love Truth 100%, you find it impossible to update your beliefs, because Truth isn't constrained by mere accuracy
    * If you love usefulness 100%, then you can find yourself taking up false beliefs because they're useful to you in the moment
* People tend to grow as rationalists when they have something to strive for, something that is more important than their own lives
* Part of the aesthetic of rationality is subordinating rationality itself to some other goal

## [Trying To Try](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/WLJwTJ7uGPA5Qphbp/trying-to-try)
* There is a big difference between being satisfied with *success* and being satisfied with a *plan for success*
* Almost any level of effort will convince us that we've tried our hardest if trying our hardest is what we have set out to do
* Instead of asking yourself, "What can I do?" ask yourself, "What needs to be done?"
* Don't try your hadest. Win, or fail

## [On Doing the Impossible](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/fpecAJLG9czABgCe9/on-doing-the-impossible)
* The word impossible has two meanings
    * Mathematically proven to be impossible
    * Not immediately apparent how to do the thing that is being described
* Any time you don't understand a domain, the problems in it will seem impossible
* Remember that confusion and impossibility are two different things, and confusion only exists in the map, not the territory
* Attempting to do the impossible is not for everyone
    * Extraordinary talent is mere prerequisite
    * Need to have extraordinary talent, and also be willing to wager years of your life on something that might not work out
* Perseverance has multiple timescales
    * One form of perseverance is working 14-hour-days
    * Another form of perseverance is working for a problem 2 hours a day for years at a time
* To do things that are impossible, you have to
    * Not turn away from the problem (seconds)
    * Work at the problem (hours)
    * Stick to the problem (years)

## [Shut Up And Do The Impossible](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/nCvvhFBaayaXyuBiD/shut-up-and-do-the-impossible)
* There is a level of effort that is higher than "tsuyoku naritai" -- "isshokenmei"
* "Isshokenmei" is a making a "desperate effort", as if your life and the life of your loved ones were at stake
* However, both tsuyoku naritai and isshokenmei involve making increasing amounts of effort within a given system or set of beliefs
* There is another level, "extraordinary effort", which involves stepping outside the belief frameworks that you currently have
* Making an extraordinary effort involves attempting to solve problems in ways that no one else is doing, ways that may lead to ridicule or censure
* To make an extraordinary effort, you have to set out to solve the problem, no matter what
* Even then, there is no guarantee of victory -- even after making an extraordinary effort, you might still lose and the problem might remain unsolved
* Losing will *hurt*, since making an extraordinary effort requires the commitment of a large amount of resources
* If you're goint to put forth an extraordinary effort, you had better make sure that the problem is worth it
