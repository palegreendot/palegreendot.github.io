## [Slack](https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/09/30/slack/)
* Slack is the absence of binding constraints on behavior
* Slack is *optionality* - the ability to change your behavior or strategy at short notice
* Out To Get You and the Attack on Slack
  * The world is filled with demands on your time, money and attention
  * If you accede to too many small demands, you'll run out of slack
  * Large demands often have a way of expanding unexpectedly to take up all of your slack
  * Sometimes this is okay - there's a time and a place for maximum effort
  * But most times are ordinary and call for ordinary effort
* "You can afford it"
  * People like to tell you that you can afford things
  * But everything you commit to take a bit out of your reserves
  * If you say yes to everything, you quickly run out of reserves
  * Instead of asking whether you can afford it, ask if it's worth it
* The Slackless Life of Maya Millenial
  * Things are really bad when the presence of slack in your life is viewed as a defection
  * There are places in the world that see slack as insufficient dedication and loyalty
  * If you're not putting your all into your career, your cause or your image, you're seen as a "failure"
* Make sure you have slack under normal circumstances
* Respect others' need for slack

## [Confessions of a Slacker](https://putanumonit.com/2017/11/07/confessions-of-a-slacker/amp/)
* Slack is the *distance* from binding constraints
* Slack can be expressed as

  ![slack equation](/assets/2017-12-18/slack_eqn.svg)

* Slack disappears as any resource approaches zero, regardless of how much of everything else you have
* Maintaining slack requires balancing all important resources, devoting particular attention to resources that you're lacking the most
* Concentrate on getting resources you need, not the resources that are easiest to obtain
* However, the scarcest resources are often the ones that are hardest to obtain, and thus many people have aversive thoughts about them
* Ignored constraints, don't go away, though. They're still binding you.
* When no single resource is especially scarce, you can figure out exchange rates between resources to help shore up resources that get drawn down more quickly
  * The classic example is the time/money trade-off between hiring someone to do a job and doing the job yourself
* Remember to account for intangible resources when tracking slack
* The main advantage of slack is that it gives you optionality - the ability to change your plans, turn down deals and explore new paths
* Be careful of highly competitive environments - they incinerate slack

## [The Rules About Responding To Call-Outs Aren't Working](https://www.realsocialskills.org/blog/the-rules-about-responding-to-call-outs-arent)
* Privileged people often ignore marginalized people
* Social justice spaces attempt to address this by instituting formal rules about how privileged people should respond to marginalized people
  * Listen to marginalized people
  * When called out by a marginalized person, don't argue
  * Believe the marginalized person, apologize, and don't engage in the called out behavior again
  * When you see others doing the same behavior, call them out
* It's not possible to follow these rules literally
  * Marginalized people are not a monolith
  * Marignalized people have the same range of opinions as privileged people
  * When you're called out for two opposite things, it's impossible to follow both directives
* Since the rules are impossible to follow, what actually happens is:
  * One opinion is lifted up as the "the opinion of marginalized people"
  * "Listening to marginalized" is reduced to agreeing with the opinion
  * Any disagreement with the opinion is reduced to "talking over marginalized people"
  * This results in fights over who is the "true voice of marginalized people"
* These rules leave marginalized people open to sabotage
  * Language of call-outs sabotages effective leaders for having insufficient ideological purity
  * Rules about shutting up and listening to marginalized make it difficult to correct lies and distortions
* Rules are exploited by abusive people
  * Rules about listening to marginalized people prevent victim from asserting their rights
  * Abuser can send victim into depressive spiral by claiming that all the things that bring the victim joy are symbols of oppressive behavior
  * Abuser may separate victim from friends and allies by spreading rumors of oppresive behavior
* Rules lack intersectionality
  * No one experiences all forms of oppression
  * People that are oppressed in different ways call each other out
* Rules prevent group dedicated to addressing one form of oppression from collaborating with groups dedicated to addressing different forms oppression
* We need to learn how to address conflicts in a substantive way

## [A Lament on Simler, et. al](https://everythingstudies.com/2017/12/05/a-lament-on-simler-et-al/)
* Critique of [the leaning tower of morality](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/11/28/the-leaning-tower-of-morality/)
* Conflates evolutionary self-interest with the common usage of the term
* Obscures the fact that "selfish" genes can produce altruistic organisms, if the altruistic behavior leads to greater spreading of the particular genes
* The evolutionary origin of altruistic behavior confuses us; we think it's "fake" because it's the result of a self-interested process
* But that's confusing outcome and process - it's possible for a selfish process to have an altruistic outcome
* When we talk about genetic selfishness, we're talking about the process that results in our behaviors, not the behaviors themselves
* There is a complete moral break between ourselves and the process that created us
* Human morality cannot and should not attempt to encompass the process of evolution
* A neurotic desire for approval
  * The world outside of our minds is fundamentally amoral
  * Why do we care that there is no universally "true" altruism?
  * Don't need to justify things to evolution - evolution is not God, nor should it be treated as one
* Notions of selfishness and unselfishness are human constructs
* We assign moral values to mechanisms by which genes spread themselves and then get confused when evolution seems to work differently from our moral intuitions

## [The Cactus and the Weasel](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2014/02/20/the-cactus-and-the-weasel/)
* The phrase "strong views, weakly held" describes hedgehogs better than foxes
* Foxes are better described with the phrase "weak views, strongly held"
* If this is surprising to you, you're probably more familiar with the degenerate forms of foxes and hedgehogs
  * Cactus - degenerate hedgehog - strong views, strongly held
  * Weasel - degenerate fox - weak views, weakly held
* True foxes and hedgehogs are both complex individuals capable of meaningfully updating in different ways
* Unlike foxes and hedgehogs, weasels and cacti are incapable of updating
* Views and hold
  * The basic distinction between foxes and hedgehogs is that while foxes have superficial knowledge of many things, hedgehogs have deep knowledge of a few things
  * To get a hedgehog to change their mind, you need to offer a single big idea that can overpower the big idea they already hold
  * This isn't hard as it sounds, because a hedgehog's big idea is often anchored by a small number of fundamental axioms
  * Undermining those axioms can cause the hedgehog to rapidly update their entire worldview
  * To get a fox to change their mind globally, you need to undermine an idea in many problem domains
  * Foxes are better at local updates, whereas hedgehogs tend to update globally
* The strength of views
  * Beliefs aren't held as disconnected sets of atomic propositions
  * Beliefs are organized into related clusters - *views*
  * If a large number of views can be connected into a global model, we can call that connected cluster of views a *world view*
  * Both foxes and hedgehogs have views, but only hedgehogs only have world-views
  * A *strong view* is one that encompasses a large set of beliefs and is interpreted as literally as possible
  * A *weak view* is one that encompasses a few critical beliefs and is interpreted in a manner that makes it easy to defend in a debate
  * The advantage of a strong view is that it's much easier to generate concrete predictions from strong views
  * In order to successfully undermine a strong view, one must pass an ideological Turing Test
* Changing Your Mind
  * We can easily change our minds when dealing with isolated, peripheral beliefs
  * When people talk about changing minds being difficult, they're talking about changing views or world-views
  * In order to change a strong view, you need to 
    * Learn new habits
    * Learn new patterns of thinking
    * Need to learn new habits first, otherwise the new patterns of thinking won't make any sense
  * Paradoxically, this means that it's easier to change a hedgehog's mind than a fox's
    * Foxes don't tie their habits as strongly to their views, so changing habits don't have same sort of global update effect that they have on hedgehogs
* Strong Views, Weakly Held
  * Successful hedgehogs cultivate the ability to change world-views rapidly
  * Recognize when a core axiom of their world-view has been undermined
  * Assume that all other beliefs associated with that world-view are now false
  * Build a new world-view on top of new habits, and treat old views as false until proven otherwise
* Weak Views, Strongly Held
  * Foxes don't have strong views, in that they don't use a single cluster of beliefs to explain large parts of the world
  * However foxes hold their views strongly - a single refutation isn't enough to trigger a global update
  * This is because views are supported by a number of independent justifications from a variety of fields, and refuting one of the justifications for a belief doesn't undermine the rest
  * Just as the challenge for a hedgehog is to rebuild their world-view rapidly, the challenge for the fox is to reorganize their beliefs quickly
  * The difference between foxes and hedgehogs is what they do with domain-independent principles
    * Hedgehogs build totalizing world-views
    * Foxes treat domain-independent principles as ad-hoc tools to use in novel situations
* Heuristic and doctrinaire religion
  * The real difference between foxes and hedgehogs is how they operate outside their "home" domain
  * Foxes start quickly, as they're able to bring in analogies and metaphors from outside the new domain to get a head start
  * Hedgehogs are slower to get started in a new domain, as they have to build up a coherent model of the entire problem first
  * However, once that coherent model is built, hedgehogs can act and coordinate much more quickly than foxes, since they can execute at the speed of subconscious habit, rather than conscious thought
  * Given that hedgehogs have deep domain knowledge of their home domain, and can outcompete foxes in new domains once new world-views get built, what is the advantage in being a fox?
* The Tetlock Edge
  * The one sustainable edge that foxes seem to have is prediction
  * Tetlock's data shows that foxes tend to be (marginally) less bad at predicting the future than hedgehogs
  * Where does this advantage come from?
    * Foxes eschew abstration, and prefer analogy, metaphor and narrative
    * By refusing to get locked into a particular set of consistent abstractions, foxes can integrate disparate and contradictory pieces of data, which hedgehogs often abandon
* The Fox/Hedgehog Duality
  * The fact that foxes don't throw away data that doesn't fit the model means that foxes slowly gain an edge as they accumulate more and more data
  * However, in order to realize this long term advantage, they have to survive against hedgehogs who are better at executing in the short term
  * Nobody can be both a fox and a hedgehog - you only have a limited amount of time and computational capacity
  * Tradeoff between ability to integrate new data and ability to execute on already collected data
* Dissolute Foxes and Hidebound Hedgehogs
  * Cactus: strong views, strongly held
    * Hedgehog that never updates becomes a cactus
    * Elevation of fundamental beliefs to unfalsifiable sacredness
  * Weasel: weak views, weakly held
    * Meta-cognition without cognition
    * Engages with ideas in purely relative terms
    * Loses the ability to evaluate the objective truth of an idea
* Foxes and hedgehogs deal differently with insincere arguments
  * Foxes can ignore insincere arguments entirely, since they're not that tied to having a globally consistent world-view
  * Hedgehogs have to detect insincere arguments in order to prevent those arguments from contaminating their world-view
    * When encountering someone with an ostensibly opposed world-view, hedgehogs probe that world-view for internal consistency
    * If the world-view is not internally consistent, then hedgehogs detect it as insincere and refuse to update on it
