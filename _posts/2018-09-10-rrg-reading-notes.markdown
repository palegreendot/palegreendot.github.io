## [Half-Assing It With Everything You've Got](http://mindingourway.com/half-assing-it-with-everything-youve-got/)

(Previously discussed on [2017-11-27](https://palegreendot.net/rrg_notes/2017/11/27/rrg-reading-notes.html#half-assing-it-with-everything-youve-got))

* Guilt/shame motivation works great right up until it stops working
* If you want to be effective, remember your goals
* Accomplish your goals with a minimum of wasted effort - doing something _too well_ can be as wasteful as not doing it well enough, since it takes away time from you accomplishing the next thing
* You don't have enough energy or enough time to do everything perfectly - focus your energy on the things that you really care about and spend a minimum of effort on the other stuff
* Remember what your goals are; deploy your full effort towards reaching them with a minimum of wasted motion

## [Failing With Abandon](http://mindingourway.com/failing-with-abandon/)

(Previously discussed on [2016-11-07](https://palegreendot.net/rrg_notes/2016/11/07/rrg-reading-notes.html#nate-soares-failing-with-abandon))

* You can limit failure
* It doesn't follow that you can drop your self control entirely just because you've missed a goal by a little bit
* You can stop yourself after going "one over"
* Remember, you put your targets there - if you missed by a little bit, remember that it's *your* target, not imposed by an external authority

## [Replacing Guilt](http://mindingourway.com/replacing-guilt/)

(Previously discussed on [2017-03-20](https://palegreendot.net/rrg_notes/2017/03/20/rrg-reading-notes.html#replacing-guilt))

* Many people are motivated by guilt, shame or some combination of the two
* This is inefficient, but it's the primary means of motivation for many effective altruists
* The problem is that leads to bursts of high intensity effort interspersed with periods of "laziness"
* This is inefficient and unsustainable
* Replace guilt-based motivation with intrinsic motivation for a steadier, more efficient, more sustainable means of working
* Goals
  * Address guilt that comes from listlessness
  * Listlessness often comes from a feeling that there must be more to life than one's day to day activities

## [The Stamp Collector](http://mindingourway.com/the-stamp-collector/)

(Previously discussed on [2017-03-20](https://palegreendot.net/rrg_notes/2017/03/20/rrg-reading-notes.html#the-stamp-collector))

* Thought experiment of the stamp-collecting robot
* Can the robot really be a stamp collector if it doesn't have access to true knowledge of its own inventory?
* This is a philosophical error
  * The robot doesn't have "true" access to any part of its own internal state
  * The robot builds a model of the world that includes itself and its stamp inventory
  * The robot applies actions to that model and takes those actions that increase the number of stamps in the model
* Actions don't have inherent value; what has value is the world-states that result from applying those actions to the present world state
* People, like the stamp collecting robot, can choose to value world states rather than internal state
  * Not everyone chooses world states that result in increases of their own short-term pleasure
  * Not every action can be explained in terms of individual pleasure maximization

## [You're Allowed To Fight For Something](http://mindingourway.com/youre-allowed-to-fight-for-something/)

(Previously discussed on [2017-03-20](https://palegreendot.net/rrg_notes/2017/03/20/rrg-reading-notes.html#replacing-guilt#youre-allowed-to-fight-for-something))

* Listless guilt is guilt that stems from not doing anything
* We can't do anything about the guilt that results from not doing anything, but we can do something about the guilt that results from not doing a particular thing
* Many people say that people only do whatever they "want" to do
  * This is broadening the term "want" to include both actions and goals
  * These are separate concepts, and therefore should be described with separate words
* You don't need a reason or excuse to care about things larger than yourself
* Many people forget that they're allowed to want a future that's different from the present
* If you have listless guilt, try to figure out what specific things you're guilty about
  * This may not make the guilt go away
  * In fact, it might make the guilt worse
  * But once you know what you're guilty about, you can take specific steps to address that guilt
