## [Famine, Affluence and Mortality](https://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/1972----.htm)

+ In 1971, in East Bengal, millions are dying from lack of food, shelter and medical care
+ These deaths are avoidable
+ However, people have not taken the necessary decisions to avoid these deaths
+ No government has given the sort of massive aid that is necessary to enable the refugees to survive for more than a few days
    + Britain, among the top givers of aid to East Bengal will spend more than 30 times as much on the Concorde
    + Australia, another top giver, will spend more than 12 times as much on the Sydney Opera House
+ The way that people in affluent countries react to situations like the East Bengal crisis cannot be justified
+ First assumption: death from lack of food, shelter, medical care, or other basic necessities are morally wrong
+ Second assumption: if it is in our power to prevent this moral wrong from occuring, without sacrificing something of equal or greater moral importance, we ought take necessary actions to prevent that moral wrong
+ These principles seem uncontroversial, but if acted upon they would change the world radically
    + Distance doesn't matter -- helping a person 10,000 miles away is as important as helping a person 10 yards away
    + Doesn't matter if you're the only person who can help or if there are millions of others who could also be helping
+ Why should we refuse to take distance into account?
    + If we accept the principles of impartiality and universalizability, we cannot discriminate against someone merely because they are far away
    + It used to be possible to argue that you know the needs of the person who is close to you better, and thus are better prepared to help that person
    + However, swift communication and transportation have obviated that argument
+ Why shouldn't it matter that there are millions of others in the same position?
    + The fact that others have done nothing says nothing about our own moral obligation
    + If everyone gave 5 pounds sterling to the Bengal Refugees Relief Fund, there would be no crisis in Bengal
    + The fact that others won't give 5 pounds means that you're obligated to give more; by giving more, you're doing more good
    + Why doesn't this become an infinite obligation?
        + The infinite obligation paradox only arises if the act of sending money is simultaneous and unexpected
        + If we build an expectation of giving, then no one has to give the maximum they're able
+ The outcome of this argument is that traditional moral categories are upset
    + Normally, giving to international food aid is considered a "charitable" donation
    + Charitable donations are "superogatory" acts -- it's good if you do them, but you're not an immoral person for not doing them
    + Singer redraws the boundary, making donating to food aid an obligatory act
+ Is this too big a revision of our moral code?
    + In the past, society drew a distinction between duties and superogatory acts in order to draw a line between behavior required for society to function and other other good behaviors
    + However, the moral point of view requires us to look beyond our own society -- the prevention of the starvation of millions is at least as important as the upholding of property norms within our society
+ Is this moral code one that people are actually capable of upholding?
    + Sidgwick and Urmson argue that we need to have a moral code that is not too far beyond the capacities of ordinary people
    + Otherwise there will be a general breakdown in compliance with the moral code
    + However, this ignores the amount of influence that moral codes have on social norms and personal behavior
        + If the expected amount that one donates is 5% of one's income, then the thought of giving away half of one's income is absurd
        + If there is a norm that no one can accumulate wealth until the least well-off are provided for, then only giving away 5% of your income will seem extremely narrow-minded
    + Finally, this consideration only applies to what we expect from others, not what we should expect from ourselves
+ There are number of other points, more practical than moral which have bearing on this issue
    + Aid ought to be given by governments, not private charity
        + Why not both?
        + No evidence that private charitable donations reduce the probability of government aid
        + Even if one is lobbying for government intervention, one should practice what they preach and give direlctlso
    + Famine relief only increases the chance of starvation later, due to population growth
        + This only means that aid should be targeted at population control, rather than famine relief
        + The total aid donated should be the same
+ How much should we be giving away?
    + The strong version of Singer's principle is that one should give until one has lowered themselves to the position of the person that they are giving to
    + The weak version of this argument is that one should give until further giving would cause the loss of something morally significant
    + Even the weak version of the argument requires a massive shifting lifestyles
    + However, these considerations are academic, given that the amount we give is so far below even the threshold of the weak form of the claim
+ Do philosophers have a role to play in public affairs?
    + It is sometimes arguemd that public policy depends on assessments of facts, and because philosophers have no specific expertise, they aren't qualified to comment on public policy
    + However, the famine is not one of these issues
        + The existence of the famine is not in doubt
        + Nor is it disputed that Western societies can help, either through direct food aid or investment in population control
    + Therefore, this is an issue in which philosophers can take a position
    + The issue is one that is faced by anyone who makes more money than is necessary to support themselves
    + It is not enough to discuss; one must also act to bring the practice of their lives more in line with philosophical theories
+ Postscript
    + While the famine in Bangladesh has ended, the world food crisis is, if anything even more serious
        + US no longer has huge grain reserves
        + Increases in the price of oil have made fertilizer and transportation more expensive
    + The case for aid remains just as great in 1972 as it does in 1971
    + However, instead of targeting direct food aid, we should target population growth reduction
    + The important is to choose the most effective target and direct a massive amount of aid at that

## [Global Health and Development](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/cause-profile-global-health-and-development/)

+ Introduction
    + In 2013, nearly 800 million people were living under the international poverty line
    + Living in poverty has a significant negative impact on health
    + People die of easily preventable illnesses, such as malaria tuberculosis and diarrhoea
    + This suffering is preventable but neglected
+ The case for global health and development as an important cause area
    + Global poverty creates a great deal of suffering for a great number of people
        + In 2013, 10.7% of the global population lived under the global poverty line of $1.90 a day
        + This line is the minimum level of income required to fulfill basic food, shelter and clothing needs
        + These people are especially vulnerable to preventable diseases
        + The damage done by these diseases runs into the millions of DALYs per year
    + There are well documented ways of reducing poverty
        + Poverty is relatively tractable if we focus on immediate costs to health and quality of life
        + Relatively simple and cheap interventions can prevent infectious disease and parasitic illnesses
    + Additional resources would do a great deal more in this area
        + Global poverty gets a great deal of attention but the actual funding level is relatively small
        + Both government and individuals allocate a relatively small number of donations to alleviating global poverty
    + We have stronger evidence for interventions in global poverty being effective than in almost any other area
        + Measurable outcomes
        + Robust record of successes
        + Certainty about actual benefit
    + Cost-effectiveness analyses and RCTs
        + Cost-effectiveness analyses attempt to quantify how much good can be done with a given amount of money
        + For example: the eradication of smallpox saved at least 60 million lives at a cost of 1.6 billion dollars
        + This works out to roughly $25 per life saved, which is amazingly cost effective
        + The most highly recommended charities today save a life for $900 -- $7,000, which is still pretty cost effective given that we spend far more to just add a couple of years to our lives in the developed world
        + Cost-effectiveness estimates are based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
            + Give intervention to half of the population, and have the other half as a control group
            + Compare outcomes
        + Interventions in global health are backed up by more RCTs than any othe cause area
    + In summary, it's possible to have a large impact on global health and development because:
        + The problem is large in scale
        + Many of the subproblems are highly tractable
        + The problem is relatively neglected, given its scale
        + The evidence for interventions is very strong
+ Concerns about prioritizing global health as a cause area
    + Does foreign aid really work?
        + While some foreign aid interventions are wasted, the average dollar of foreign aid does a lot of good
        + Even if all other foreign aid was wasted the eradiction of smallpox would have been worth it
    + Charity "beings at home"
        + Additional resources can do a lot more good per unit in the developing world than in the developed world
        + Developing countries lack resources and their problems are ones that we've solved at home
    + Who are we to say what poor people need
        + It's possible to intervene without being paternalistic
        + Concerns about paternalism seem less pressing when people have clear and pressing needs
+ Why you might *not* choose to prioritize this cause area
    + There might be better ways to improve the lives of people living today
        + Mental health problems might be causing more suffering than poverty
        + Investing in a broader cause area might improve the decision-making of all humanity, improving our ability to solve not just this problem, but all problems
        + We need to avoid the "streetlight fallacy" of investing in cause areas simply because it's easy to build RCTs around their interventions
    + We should prioritize reducing the suffering of non-human animals
        + Over 50 billion animals currently live in conditions of extreme suffering before being slaughtered in factory farms
        + There is even less spent on this than is spent on fighting global poverty
        + Comparing the two depends on the following judgment calls
            + The significance of animal suffering compared to human suffering -- is human suffering more morally significant
            + The indirect effects of poverty interventions vs. animal suffering interventions -- do efforts to reduce poverty have more positive spillover effects?
            + Importance of a strong evidence base -- we have far more evidence that efforts to alleviate human poverty work
    + We should prioritize the long-run survival of humanity
        + If we think we can affect the long run future, focusing on that might have a higher impact than focusing on more immediate problems
        + How much moral weight should we give future people
        + How much weight should we give the "non-identity problem"
            + Policies enacted today will determine what jobs and lives people have, who they marry, etc
            + These policies will affect how good the lives of future people are
            + How can we balance policies that cause future people to come into existence, but make them worse off?
        + Can our actions have any impact on the far future
        + Maybe the best way of fixing long-term problems is by fixing the short-term problems first?
    + We might want to focus on systemic change
        + Poverty reduction only addresses the symptoms of poverty, not its root causes 
        + Not clear whether focusing on the immediate issues will help us end poverty altogether
        + Current marginal efforts are probably best spent helping the poor directly, rather than on politics
+ Summary
    + Global poverty causes a huge amount of suffering
    + One of the worse consequences of this is preventable disease
    + We have a number of highly effective interventions for treating diseases
    + We have strong evidence that these interventions work and are cost effective
    + It's plausible that we should further systemic change to solve these issues
    + However, systemic change might be best effected by giving local participants the ability to better influence their own futures
    + Whether you believe this to be the most important cause depends on
        + Whether you believe there are other better ways to improve human lives
        + How much marginal value you give to reducing human suffering
        + Whether you believe it more important to focus on the long-term future of humanity

## [GiveWell's Criteria for Top Charities](https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/criteria)

+ The top charities GiveWell recommends to donors are characterized by:
    + Evidence of effectiveness
        + Programs should be studied rigorously and repeatedly
        + Benefits should be expected to generalize
        + Can the charity execute?
    + Cost effectiveness
        + Estimate cost required to accomplish a particular benefit
        + People in the developing world have a dramatically lower standard of living, so a single dollar can help them more
    + Room for more funding
        + Top charities receive a significant number of donations as a result of GiveWell's recommendations
        + Will these additional funds be well spent?
    + Transparency
        + Potential top charities are examined thoroughly and skeptically
        + Charities must be open to this investigative process
+ Why these criteria?
    + Effectiveness
        + Most information about charities is simplified, exaggerated or incomplete
        + In order to judge what donation will do the most good, one needs to answer the following questions:
            + What will the donation permit that would not have otherwise have happened?
            + Will this activity change people's lives for the better, or will it run into challenges
            + Will it accomplish a large amount of good, relative to other possible donations
        + While one can make an informed assessment of these questions by examining charities in detail, not everyone has the time to do this
        + GiveWell focuses on charities that are verifiably outstanding, for whom a case can be made without relying on judgment calls
    + Global poverty
        + Developing world poverty is far more severe than developed world poverty
        + Each dollar goes farther in the developing world
    + Direct causes over root causes
        + Root cause efforts require far more donor engagement
        + Addressing direct causes can empower people to address root causes themselves
        + Donors should focus on areas that they're best able to help
+ Why so few charities
    + GiveWell focuses on a relatively small sector of the charitable sector
    + Only assesses charities that publish the statistics that allow them to be assessed
    + Evaluation is time-intensive
+ The process for identifying top charities
    + Find eligible charities
        + Search for charities
        + Look at applications
    + Examine charities
        + Deeply examine charity's impact
        + Find out strengths and weaknesses of charity
    + Follow up
        + Track performance over time
        + Write about both positive and negative outcomes
