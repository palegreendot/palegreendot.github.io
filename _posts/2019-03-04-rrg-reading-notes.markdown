## [Effective Altruists Love Systemic Change](https://80000hours.org/2015/07/effective-altruists-love-systemic-change/)

+ There is nothing in principle that rules out using wide-spread legal, cultural, or political changes to make the world a better place
+ Examples of EAs working on systemic change:
    + Many OpenPhilanthropy grants are are focused on immigration reform, criminal justice reform, macroeconomics, institutional development and other structural changes
    + OpenBorders.info -- collates material promoting open borders as an option to increase the migration from poor countries to rich ones
    + EAPolicy -- makes recommendations to open policy forums held by the US government
    + One of GiveWell's primary goals has been to structurally change the nonprofit sector by promoting a new model for charity evaluation
    + Giving What We Can has met with the UK government to give feedback on foreign aid targeting
    + 80,000 Hours alumni have gone into politics and business to effect systemic change
    + Organizations focused on X-Risk have taken a large interest in government policies that could influence the regulation of new techologies and development of institutions which could promote inter-state cooperation and conflict prevention
+ There are other systemic changes which 80,000 Hours has researched that show promise for future action
    + Significantly more spending on development aid
    + Changes to financial regulations to make it more difficult to externalize risk
    + Pricing greenhouse gas emissions
    + More interantional cooperation around the containment and prevention of contagious disease
+ 80,000 Hours already has positive views on careers in politics and policy; however there isn't enough research yet to confidently recommend such careers over all the alternatives
+ Therefore, it's not accurate to say that 80,000 Hours is hostile to systemic change
+ So why might there be a perception that 80,000 Hours is against systemic change?
    + "Earning to give" is perceived as being anti-systemic change
        + However, earning-to-give is neutral on systemic change
        + Someone who earns to give and gives all of their income to a person working for systemic change is working for systemic change themselves
        + Example: Engels traveled back to Britain and entered his father's business in order to earn an income to support Marx
    + Effective Altruists are usually not radicals or revolutionaries
        + Sudden dramatic changes in society usually lead to worse outcomes than gradual changes
        + EAs favor marginal changes to existing systems rather than throwing everything out and starting from scratch
    + Effective Altruists work on systemic changes that are more likely to be achieved
    + Effective Altruists have chosen to take on the task of figuring out what does the most good
        + This is an enormous task
        + Makes sense to start with the parts we *can* do right away, and then focus on the bigger systemic changes later
+ Effective Altruism is compatible with systemic change -- the question is how best to get those systemic changes

## [Beware Systemic Change](https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/09/22/beware-systemic-change/?comments=false)

+ One of the most common critiques of Effective Altruism is that it focuses too narrowly on specific monetary interventions rather than fighting for systemic change
+ This has led to leaders in the EA movement writing about how the EA movement isn't opposed to systemic change, and is in fact in favor of it
+ However, maybe EA *should* be opposed to systemic change
    + Traditional charity is viewed as being universally good, or at least neutral
    + Some political issues are viewed like this
    + However, on many political issues, like gun control or increasing the minimum wage, there are activists on both sides
    + The lack of progress is because there are two sides, and each side is canceling out the efforts of the other
    + There's no guarantee that EAs wouldn't also split, and then cancel each other out, burning resources that could be better used for charity
    + Moreover, the track record of EAs pursuing systemic change isn't great
        + Engels supported Marx in a manner that can only be described as effective altruism, but Marxism was a disaster
        + There was widespread liberal support for Stalin
        + There was also widespread liberal support for eugenics
    + Systemic change has significant asymmetric downside risk -- there are many more ways of being wrong than there are of being right
+ Systemic change is controversial and focusing on it threatens to tear the nascent EA movement apart
    + EAs got into a controversy over the non-vegetarian food being an option at EA Global
    + Can a community which can't even agree on what to serve for lunch really handle focusing on systemic issues that are genuinely controversial?
+ Advocating for incremental changes allows EA to avoid a whole host of failure modes
+ EA currently has a strong moral message -- we should be wary of diluting it

## [How Not To Be A "White In Shining Armor"](https://ea.greaterwrong.com/posts/3wvLSv6aYaGBKwf9S/how-not-to-be-a-white-in-shining-armor)

+ One of the objections to EA is that EA approaches seem to only work for certain constrained problems, like infectious disease
+ Why doesn't EA try to tackle broader issues, like economic growth, gender equity, economic inequality, etc?
+ This objection commits the fallacy of viewing the developed-world donor as being the only person who can help the developing-world beneficiary
+ EAs believe that progress must be locally-driven
    + Give money to "low-insulation" charities which have a good track record
    + Need to make sure that we're not consolidating power among local elites
+ Global health and nutrition
    + EAs should focus on areas where they are confident that they can make a significant positive impact
    + Health issues is the most prominent of these areas
+ Another way of helping the poor is direct cash transfers
    + Direct cash transfers give complete control to locals
    + GiveWell now ranks GiveDirectly as one of its top three charities

## [The Animal-Free Food Movement Should Move Towards an Institutional Message](https://medium.com/@jacyreese/the-animal-free-food-movement-should-move-towards-an-institutional-message-534d7cd0298e)

+ Vegetarianism and veganism started out as fringe diets for the ascetic
+ In recent years, however, these diets have started to become more mainstream
+ However, if we're going to make vegetarianism truly universal, we need to focus on institutional messaging
+ Historical precedent for institutional messaging
    + The animal-free food movement has a virtually unprecedented focus on individual consumer change
    + One of the only other movements to have a similar focus was the "free-produce" movement, which focused on buying "slavery-free" products
    + The free-produce movement was influential in the early 1800s, but by 1840, even its proponents had come to the conclusion that institutional change was required to fight slavery
    + Some in the environmental movement feel the same way about "green consumerism"
        + Emphasis on affecting individual choices makes activists complacent
        + Environmental movement, as a result, has been moving more towards institutional messaging, by focusing on systemic changes go energy and industry regulation rather than individual choices
    + One potential counterexample for institutional messaging is the success of the anti-tobacco movement, which largely used individual messaging
+ Avoiding the "collapse of compassion"
    + "Collapse of compassion" refers to the low levels of compassion that many people feel towards large problems that affect large numbers of individuals
    + People expect the needs of large groups to be overwhelming and engage in emotional regulation in order to not experience overwhelming levels of emotion
    + We might be able to avoid the collapse of compassion by making it clear that problems are solvable and there's a concrete path to success
    + Taking collective action feels more meaningful than just changing our own diet
    + On the other hand, institutional messaging might be too aggressive or totalitarian-sounding for people to accept
+ Evoking "moral outrage" and expressing the seriousness of the issue
    + Moral outrage: "a special type of anger, one that ignites when people recognize that a person or institution has violated a moral principle and must be prevented from continuing to do so"
    + Moral outrage is a response to others' behavior, never one's own
    + Institutional messaging places the blame for an issue on an outside institution or an institution that the person is only a small part of
    + Moral outrage allows people to break from "system justification" -- an often irrational defense of the status quo
    + Activist motivation is often driven by emotions that are similar to, but broader than moral outrage
+ Peer pressure
    + Institutional messaging has more peer pressure built in
    + In order to deliver institutional messages people need to coordinate in large groups, which lets them know that they are not isolated individuals
+ We're biased in favor of individual messaging because of our general psychological desire for instant gratification
+ Counterargument: individual messaging has a clear call to action with spillover benefits
    + Individual change is something that you can do right away
    + Individual change has a shorter feedback loop, allowing you to see if your messaging is having an impact
+ There might be ways to combine individual messaging and institutional messaging to capture the benefits of both
+ The tentative preponderance of evidence is that institutional messaging is a better use of marginal resources than individual messaging for the animal-free food movement
