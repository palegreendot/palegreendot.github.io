## [Book Review: Surfing Uncertainty](http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/05/book-review-surfing-uncertainty/)
* Predictive Processing is the unifying framework theory of how the brain works
* Begins by asking, "How does raw sense data get turned into a unified picture of the world?"
  * Brain is a multi-layer prediction machine
  * 2 streams
    * Bottom-up stream of sense-data that is progressively filtered and abstracted
    * Top-down stream of predictions - starts with abstract models and generates predictions for lower layers
  * Both streams are probabilistic
  * 2 streams interact with each other at each layer of cognitive processing (using Bayes Theorem) to integrate the two sources of probabilisitic evidence
  * Possible outcomes of this interaction
    * Prediction and sense data match: models are good and layer stays quiet
    * Low-precision sense-data mismatches high-precisiion predictions
      * Prediction is probably more correct than sense data
      * Reinterpret sense data to match prediction
    * Unresolvable conflict between sense data and prediction
      * Signals "suprisal"
      * Alert that higher levels have to update their model
      * Surprisal signals for the stream of "low-level" data for higher levels
  * Perception is the result of these interactions
  * Top-down models explain why our brains can resolve pictures from noisy images, read words that have the letters jumbled, and automatically skip over grammatical errors
* How does Predictive Processing explain pretty much everything about our perception?
  * Attention
    * Predictive processing measures the "confidence interval of predictions"
    * High-attention: perception is driven by bottom-up stream of sense data
    * Low attention: perception is driven by top-down stream of predictions from models
  * Imagination, dreaming, etc
    * The highest levels of our brain make predictions
    * As these predictions filter down into lower levels, they're turned into specific sensations that we ought to be perceiving (which are then compared to incoming sense data)
    * Dreams and hallucinations are predictions that are either unconstrained or are weakly constrained by sense-data
  * Priming
    * Priming constrains the set of predictions, and thus makes it more likely that the brain will decode sensory data in a particular way
  * Learning
    * The brain is constantly creating models and generating sense-data predictions from them
    * Models that perform well are retained, while models that do not perform well are discarded
    * Hyperpriors - priors that one must have to form coherent models in the first place
      * Synchronicity of senses - different senses describe the same world
      * Object permanence - things don't go away when we stop looking at them
    * While hyperpriors may be innate, infant behavior indictates that even hyperpriors may be learned
  * Motor behavior
    * Predictive processing isn't something that informs our motor control, it *is* our motor control
    * Sometimes it's easier to update the world to fit the model rather than updating the model to fit the world
    * The driver for us to move our bodies is a prediction that our bodies will be in a particular location
  * Placebo effect
    * Placebos operate much like priming described above
    * Bias the brain's models to interpret sense data in particular ways
  * Neurochemistry
    * Predictive processing provides a coherent framework for what various neurotransmitters actually do
    * NDMA-glutamatergic system - top-down predictions
    * AMPA-glutamatergic system - bottom-up sense data
    * Dopamine - confidence intervals and other metadata
  * Autism & Schizophrenia
    * Both autism and schizophrenia can be interpreted as problems with updating models
    * Autism: models are too precise
      * Reality constantly deviates from models, generating surprisal signals
      * Explains why autistic people get irritated by minor things, like tags on clothing
      * Also explains why autistic people do well in certain fields that require high-precision models
    * Schizophrenia: models are too broad & agree with sense data too readily
      * More likely to assign significance to weak or noisy sense data
      * Aren't fooled by optical illusions (which take advantage of models' ability to overwrite sensory perceptions)
      * Schizophrenic delusions are the result of the brain assigning significance to every bit of sense data, no matter how minor or noisy
* Predictive processing puts the rationalist project on a sounder scientific footing - shows the mechanisms by which our brains update; we just need to figure out how to make this system update better and faster

## [Predictive Processing and Perceptual Control](http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/06/predictive-processing-and-perceptual-control/)
* Predictive Processing is presaged by Powers' Perceptual Control Theory
* PCT is a good theory but it's better seen as an approximation of Predictive Processing
* If Predictive Processing does turn out to be the grand unified theory of the mind, PCT will be seen as an important precursor

## [How Do We Get Breasts Out Of Bayes Theorem](http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/07/how-do-we-get-breasts-out-of-bayes-theorem/)
* The one thing that Predictive Processing has trouble with is instincts
* If the brain is one big prediction/verification machine, where do "hard-wired" instincts fit into that?
* Maybe sometimes there's enough of an evolutionary advantage to "hard-wiring" certain features (like recognizing beaks with red dots, in the case of seagulls) that it happens
* Maybe instincts are the "default weights" assigned to models, and that most people go along with the defaults
