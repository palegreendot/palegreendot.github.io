## [You Don't Get To Know What You're Fighting For](http://mindingourway.com/you-dont-get-t/)

Previously discussed on [2017-03-20](https://palegreendot.net/rrg_notes/2017/03/20/rrg-reading-notes.html#you-dont-get-to-know-what-youre-fighting-for)

* It's a lot easier to know what you're working against than to know what you're working for
* When we work towards a goal, we often find that the goals shifts or evaporates as we work towards it
* Even if you say you know what you're fighting for, it's possible to be wrong
  * Humans have extremely imperfect introspection
  * We should be suspicious of anyone who claims to know their entire preference set
* Fortunately, you don't need to have a precise definition of what you're fighting for in order to be an effective altruist
* It's possible to know that a direction is correct, even if you can't clearly formulate a description of the destination
* The world is awful enough that most of the time, it suffices to select the action that's least incorrect and do that

## ["Should" Considered Harmful](http://mindingourway.com/should-considered-harmful/)

Previously discussed on [2017-04-03](https://palegreendot.net/rrg_notes/2017/04/03/rrg-reading-notes.html#should-considered-harmful)

* The word "should" puts us in direct and unnecessary conflict with ourselves
* Saying "should" immediately removes the direct motivation for a task and turns it into an obligation
* If you start to fail at a task that you "should" be succeeding at, you panic, and that only makes the failure worse
* Think through every alternative branch, even the ones where you fail
	- You don't have to convince yourself that failure is okay
	- Thinking about failures makes scenarios concrete
	- Concrete scenarios are easier to reason about and guard against
* Keep a tally of whenever you use the word "should"
* Restate your obligations without the word "should"

## [Not Because You "Should"](http://mindingourway.com/not-because-you-should/)

Previously discussed on [2017-04-03](https://palegreendot.net/rrg_notes/2017/04/03/rrg-reading-notes.html#not-because-you-should)

* Stop doing things because you "should"
* "Should" is not a basis for motivation
* Find the real reasons for performing actions
* If you can't find a reason beyond "should", maybe you don't need to perform the action
* The best way to become an altruist is to have a genuine desire to help, not a "should"-based moral obligation

## [Your "shoulds" are not a duty](http://mindingourway.com/shoulds-are-not-a-duty/)

Previously discussed on [2017-04-03](https://palegreendot.net/rrg_notes/2017/04/03/rrg-reading-notes.html#your-shoulds-are-not-a-duty)

* Objection: If we put our wants on the same scale as our moral obligations, we might make the "wrong" choice
* If it's possible for your wants to override your moral obligations, then maybe they're not really your moral obligations
* There is not external authority telling you that you should do things
  * "Should" comes from within
  * A real moral commitment doesn't even feel like a choice - the right thing to do is "obvious" and you go do it

## [Working yourself ragged is not a virtue](http://mindingourway.com/stop-before-you-drop/)

Previously discussed on [2017-04-03](https://palegreendot.net/rrg_notes/2017/04/03/rrg-reading-notes.html#working-yourself-ragged-is-not-a-virtue)

* There is a pernicious belief that it is unvirtuous to stop working if you're physically able to continue
* Your goal is to maximize the integral of productivity, not the derivative
	- Slowing down can be helpful if it allows you to work for longer
* Your body and mind are limited resources; they need to be used as wisely as anything else
