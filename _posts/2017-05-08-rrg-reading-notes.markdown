## [I, Pencil](http://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/rdPncl1.html)
* Claim: not a single person can make a pencil, from end to end
* Antecedents
	- Pencil starts out as a cedar tree
	- Think about all the work that goes into making the tools to cut down the cedar tree
	- Cedar logs are shipped to a sawmill
	- Think about all the work and infrastructure that goes into the operation of a sawmill
	- From the sawmill, slats are shipped to a pencil factory
		- $4 million machine that carves grooves into the cedar slats
		- Pencil lead made from Sri Lankan graphite, combined with Mississippi clay and various waxes
		- Pencil coloring comes from yellow lacquer
			- Think about all of the ingredients and expertise that went into making just the coloring on the outside of the pencil
		- Pencil's ferrule is made out of brass and nickel
			- Think about the copper, tin and nickel that was mined
			- Think about the blackening process that allows the nickel to form the distinctive black band
* No one knows
	- No single person in the process of pencil manufacture can make the whole pencil from raw materials
	- Each person in the chain contributes an infinetesimal amount of effort, often without realizing that they're working towards the manufacture of pencils
	- However, when all of these efforts are combined, the result is over a billion pencils a year
* No master-mind
	- There is no single individual or organization masterminding the production of pencils
	- The fact that we can make pencils at all should give us faith in the ability of free people to organize themselves around the production of goods and services
* Testimony galore
	- Let society's legal apparatuses remove obstacles, not create them

## [A Big Little Idea Called Legibility](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/)
* "Legibility" is introduced in James C. Scott's _Seeing Like A State_
* The Authoritarian High Modernist Recipe for Failure
	- Look at a complex and confusing reality
	- Fail to understand the subtleties of how that reality works
	- Attribute the failure to the irrationality of reality rather than deficiencies in your model
	- Come up with an idealized vision of what reality ought to look like
	- Argue that the platonic orderliness of your idealized vision means that it's more rational
	- Bulldoze reality to fit the idealized vision
	- Watch as your utopia crashes and burns
* Legibility and control
	- The central problem of modern statecraft has been one of making populations legible
	- Legibility is the ease by which on-the-ground reality can be processed by a centralized bureaucracy
	- States attempt to reorganize their territory (both physical and social) in order to make it more legible
	- Legible terrain is easier to control
	- The main failure of high modernism was to confuse legibility with rationality
* The psychology of legibility
	- Apparent chaos is anxiety provoking
	- The effort to make society legible can be understood as an organizational response to that anxiety
* The fertility of the idea
	- The concept of legibility appears simple but has explanatory power over a wide range of circumstances
	- Not all attempts to make reality legible result in disasters
		- Standardized weights and measures make global trade and infrastructure possible
		- Trade a multitude of local optima for a single global optimum
	- The reason legibility is so dangerous is that people pursuing legibility do not understand the tradeoff between local and global optima
	- The imposition of legibility is pursued as a pseudo-scientific prescription that claims to be the best for everyone
	- The failure mode of legibility can be seen in mid-20th century urban planning
		- Planners bulldoze illegible but livable neighborhoods and replace them with legible but unlivable apartment towers
		- In the worst case (e.g. Brazilia) planners create entire cities in this style
	- The failure mode is much worse when applied to agriculture
		- "Scientific" forestry
		- Soviet collectivization
		- Ethiopian famine
* Applying the idea
	- Modern caste system in India allegedly arises from the British making a complex reality fit into four neat little boxes
* The model is still relevant today
	- Time lag between the high-water mark of an ideology and the last of its effects
	- Authoritarian regimes love authoritarian high modernism
	- The desire to make things legible is a common failure of organizations - not limited to modernist thinkers
	- Modern design approaches make the same mistakes, but give them different names
* Authoritarian high modernism in corporate and personal life
	- Authoritarian high modernism explains both the appeal and the limitation of the self-help industry
		- Individual lives are too complex to fit into neat self-help systems
		- Attempting to simplify your life so that it does fit into a self-help system is likely to end in disaster
	- Corporations are just as susceptible to the failures of authoritarian high modernism as are governments
		- The difference is that corporations (sometimes) have to answer to consumers when they try to make their customers legible

## [Astronomical Waste: The Opportunity Cost of Delayed Technological Development](http://www.nickbostrom.com/astronomical/waste.html)
* The rate of loss of potential lives
	- Think of all the energy that is being currently expended heating empty space
	- Virgo Supercluster contains on the order of $$10^13$$ stars
	- Assuming that each star's entire output can be captures and converted into computation at current efficiency levels, there are potentially 10^38 lives that could be simulated
	- Even if we limit ourselves to biological humans, this area of the universe could potentially sustain 10^23 humans
	- Every second that the entire supercluster is not colonized represents the loss of up to 10^14 biological human lives
* The opportunity cost of delayed colonization
	- Any technology that increases the speed at which space colonization is achieved has a huge utilitarian payoff
	- Any value system which aggregates human desires ought to push for space colonization
* The chief goal for utilitarians should be to minimize existential risk
	- Any change to _when_ humans colonize the universe is massively offset by changes to the probability of humans ever colonizing the universe
* Implications for aggregative person-affecting views
	- Even if you only consider the lives of people that would be cut short by an existential catastrophe, you should still assign a high cost to X-Risk
	- There is a small probability that the people whose lives would be cut short by an existential catastrophe would have become immortal due to a technological singularity, or some other mechanism
	- Safety trumps speed, but we should still advance towards space colonization as fast as we can

## [A Hanging](http://orwell.ru/library/articles/hanging/english/e_hanging)
* _I'm not summarizing this. George Orwell is a wonderful writer, and you should just read the essay_

## [How To Do What You Love](http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html)
* To do something well, you have to like it
* School is tedious because its meant to be preparation for adults' conception of work
* However, society tells us that we're supposed to enjoy our work
  * The people who are best at their jobs like their jobs
	- Pretending to like your job is a way of signalling that you're good at what you do
* This conflict between social messages leads to alienation
* Doing what you love doesn't mean doing what you want to do on a moment-to-moment basis
* Unproductive pleasures pall eventually
* To be happy, you have to do something you both enjoy and admire
* Don't worry about prestige - prestige is a way to get ambitious people to do boring work
* If you've even admitted to yourself that you hate your job, you're a step ahead
* Finding what really motivates you is hard
	- Try to do a good job, even if you don't like what you're doing - that way you can't use laziness as an excuse
	- Always produce - if you force yourself to always be producing, eventually you'll converge on what you actually _like_ to produce
* How do you get paid to do what you love?
	- Organic route: start out doing both stuff you like and stuff you hate; then, as you get better and more acclaimed, start cutting out the stuff you hate
	- 2-job route: either try to make enough money so that you can do what you like or keep a "day job" so that you can work on what you like in your spare time
	- If what you like to do is something that people will pay for, go with the organic route, otherwise go with the 2-job route
	- Whichever route you take, expect difficulty
