## [Living In An Inadequate World](https://equilibriabook.com/living-in-an-inadequate-world/)
- Even inadequate systems only have a finite amount of failure
- Sloppy cynicism will usually be wrong because the system isn't *as* broken as the completely cynical view would have it be
- Seeing inadequacy everywhere is functionally as bad never seeing inadequacy
- The point of learning inadequacy analysis is to give yourself permission to try novel strategies while having an understanding of where those strategies are likely to work
  - Break blind trust in institutions
  - Also learn where institutions are likely to be correct
- Three step process:
  - Break blind trust in institutions
  - Calibrate until you're not always seeing exploitability or inexploitability
  - Fine tune against reality
- When we think about inadequacy, we're deciding whether we trust society to be more or less competent than we are
- The "modest" viewpoint turns competence into a marker of social status
  - Doing better implies being better
  - However, our beliefs should not be determined by what sort of person we are -- they should be determined by the state of the world
  - The true alternative to modest epistemology isn't an "immodest" epistemology, where you think you know better than society
  - The true alternative is to realize that society doesn't *always* know better and then decide for yourself on a case-by-case basis
- Realize that often will perform worse (on a per-case basis) because of misaligned incentives
- It takes far less effort to *identify* a correct expert than it does to *become* a correct expert
- When looking for exploitability, pick your battles - it's easy to think that a system in inadequate and exploitable when it's not
  - Coming up with a truly novel model is something you'll only do once or twice in your lifetime
  - A brand new synthesis of pre-existing ideas is something that'll happen to you once or twice a year
  - Picking between differing experts when you can follow their arguments is something that you can do quite frequently
- Fortunately most day-to-day decisions don't require the creation of novel models or new syntheses - finding the "right" expert is usually sufficient
- To improve everyday thinking about inadequacy
  - Update hard every time you come across new data
  - Don't worry so much about overcorrecting - as long as you leave yourself open to new data, additional input will cause you to correct back
  - Bet real money on everything - don't have to bet a lot, but the process of betting makes the prediction "real"

## [Blind Empiricism](https://equilibriabook.com/blind-empiricism/)
- Being a "fox" in the Isaiah Berlin sense shouldn't preclude you from building models
- Build theoretical frameworks, and then abandon them when reality proves them wrong
- The ideology of empiricism is harmful if it prevents you from making predictions or inferences
- Being cognizant of the outside view is helpful but make sure that the outside view is actually applicable to your situation
  - In many novel situations, there are multiple plausible outside views
  - It's not trivial to figure out which reference class is most applicable
  - In many cases (especially in the sciences) the outside view can't compete with a good model
- The fact that you'll have to give up the theory if it's proven wrong shouldn't prevent you from building the theory
