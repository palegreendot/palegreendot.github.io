## [Making Beliefs Pay Rent (In Anticipated Experiences)](http://lesswrong.com/lw/i3/making_beliefs_pay_rent_in_anticipated_experiences/)
* Our great strength and our great weakness is that we can model the unseen
    * Can build network of causes connected to sensory experience
    * Can build network of causes disconnected from sensory experience
* Empiricism - constant ask what your beliefs predict and what they prohibit
* Maintain a list of things that would falsify your beliefs
* Don't ask what to believe, ask what to anticipate

## [Taboo Your Words](http://lesswrong.com/lw/nu/taboo_your_words/)
* Replace words with definitions to clarify points of disagreement
* Tabooing words can dissolve disagreements caused by differing interpretations of the same word
* Tabooing words can reveal disagreements caused by using the same word to paper over distinctions between two concepts
* If a philosophical term is giving you trouble, try to formulate the argument without using that term at all

## [Confidence Levels Inside and Outside An Argument](http://lesswrong.com/lw/3be/confidence_levels_inside_and_outside_an_argument/)
* Confidence levels inside an argument - probability estimate generated by model
* Confidence levels outside an argument - probability estimate generated by model and probability of model being correct
* Doubt in validity of model should push you back towards your priors
* If your model is coming up with very low or very high probabilities, examine the assumptions behind the model

## [Knowing About Biases Can Hurt People](http://lesswrong.com/lw/he/knowing_about_biases_can_hurt_people/)
* If you're irrational, more knowledge can hurt you
* People are way more likely to use knowledge about biases to knock down arguments they disagree with than arguments they agree with
* Biases and fallacies can be fully general counterarguments if you're not careful about applying them properly

## [If It's Worth Doing, It's Worth Doing With Made Up Statistics](http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/02/if-its-worth-doing-its-worth-doing-with-made-up-statistics/)
* Imperfect information still beats zero information
* Fermi-estimating statistics can still give you enough information to make decisions
* Just thinking about and going with the base rate can counteract many cognitive biases
* Applying made-up models can train us to notice where our intuitions are wrong
