## [The Craft and the Community: A Post-Mortem & Resurrection](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/wmEcNP3KFEGPZaFJk/the-craft-and-the-community-a-post-mortem-and-resurrection#top)

### Preface
* This is the most comprehensive list of criticisms of the rationality community
* Not a rejection of the group
* Need to create a shared understanding of problems so that we can work on fixing them
* Essay prioritizes clarity over civility - may rub some people the wrong way as a result

### Introduction
* It's been almost 10 years since the publication of *The Craft and the Community*
* What has the rationalist community accomplished in the meantime?
* Why hasn't our community been more successful?
* What has happened is that the people who were most interested in instrumental rationality found the community to be a timesink and left

### Post-Mortem: What Went Wrong
* It's somewhat surprising that a community so full of potential has acheived so little
* The median person in the rationality community is about as successful as they would have been if they had not discovered the rationality community
* Why hasn't the rationalist community been able to beat the "control group" of wider society?
* 3 inter-related causes
    * Demographics
    * Environment
    * Culture

### Problems and Causal Factors

#### Demographics: Background Selection Effects
* The sequences disproportionately attracted people who enjoy debate over action
* The rationality community has a much higher than baseline rate of mental illness
* Draw disproportionately from those with liberal upper-middle-class values
* There are three main focus areas of the rationality community
    * Impact focus
        * Effective altruism
        * Ambitious startups
        * Driving major social change
    * Human focus
        * Relationships
        * Meaningful work
        * Happiness and fun
    * Truthseeking focus
        * Curiosity for its own sake
        * Deep theoretical models
        * Empiricism
* Each of these focus areas has its own problems
    * Truthseeking focus
        * Deep theoretical models, particularly for psychology and sociology, don't work very well
        * People from blue-tribe, high-trust enviroments come up with these models and they don't realize that they don't work very well outside of that environment
        * Socially maladjusted people come up with these models - leads to blind leading the blind
        * Idealism prevents people from making changes to their models in the face of contradictory data
    * Impact focus
        * Inability to recruit underrepresented demographics
            * Incomprehensible jargon
            * Far too much reliance on physics, computer science or science fiction analogies
            * The community has been optimized for a narrow demographic, whereas the concepts of rationality can help almost anyone
        * Inability to run non-business projects
            * Project leaders do far too much work because we treat individualism and dissent as terminal values
            * Analysis paralysis, combined with short attention spans leads to poor decision-making
            * Volunteers aren't pro-active which puts even more strain on leaders
            * The number of volunteers for any given project is tied to how "shiny" the project feels
        * Distrust of outsiders reduces intake and spread of information
            * We're overreliant on the skills of insiders
            * No way to evaluate insider skills except through cultural shibboleths that may or may not be well correlated with the actual skills we're interested in
            * We end up reinventing lots of wheels because we systematically devalue outsider opinions
        * Lack of focus on instrumental rationality
            * The community is better at reading, writing and debating than it is at actually doing things
            * Focus on AI alignment has sucked all the talent away from more pedestrian causes
            * Most practical impact-focused people have moved over to EA, making rationality community demographics even worse
            * Underacheiving demographics have contributed to a cultural undervaluation of hard work and attention to detail
    * Human/community focus
        * Romantic dissatisfaction of straight men
            * Huge gender gap means that most men can't have romantic relationships inside the community
            * The community is passively hostile to women insofar as it is not a place where intellectually capable women wish to spend time
        * Difficulty forming deeper friendships
            * People have trouble making friends not because they desire solitude, but because they don't have the social skills to make friends
            * Biases towards social awkwardness and passivity make it difficult to have the recurring interactions that result in lasting friendships
        * Difficulty executing short term plans
            * People flake on plans that they've ostensibly committed to
            * People don't inform others when they're going to be late or when they're going to be unable to attend
            * It's difficult to make plans when you don't know how many people are going to show up or when they're going to show up
        * Almost complete inability to execute plans on longer time-horizons
            * People struggle with stepping outside of their day-to-day lives and looking at things from a higher level
            * Values like loyalty are seen as Red-tribe outgroup traits and responded to with derision
        * Lacking a sense that more is possible
            * People don't know what great communities actually look like
            * This is due to a combination of rationalist demographics and problems with greater social atomization
        * People feel the need to sell themselves
            * High turnover in the community means that first impressions matter far more than they otherwise would
            * This leads to people selling themselves in whatever way will work out best for them
            * Then, in turn, people who don't engage in explicit signalling feel like losers in a game that they never agreed to play
* Three things that can be done to try to resolve demographic and cultural issues
    * Throw everything we can at trying to alter our demographic make-up
        * Likely to fail
        * Likely to ruin the community in the process
    * Attempt to start afresh, severing ties with the existing community
        * But how do you know you won't just make the same mistakes again?
    * Shift culture in an attempt to compensate for weaknesses
        * The most promising option, but far from a guaranteed success
        * Requires us to pay attention to unpleasant topics, rather than reading the latest insight porn

#### Environment: Picking The Wrong Location
* There is no distinction between "the rationality community" and "rationalists in Berkeley"
* Putting the center of the community in Berkeley was possibly the worst strategic decision we ever made
* The values of the wider Berkeley community are hostile to rationalist values
* Most rationalists and rationalist organizations do not benefit from being in Berkeley
* Berkeley is the most politically correct city in America - how can we have a community dedicated to free speech and free thought in a location that engages in social-justice witch-hunts?
* Being in Berkeley means that the recruitment pool for the rationality community is subject to Silicon Valley demographics, amplifying the demographic problems of the rationality community
* These background effects actively get in the way of attempting to fix the problems in the community

#### Social Turnover Has Increased To The Point Where It Has Major Effects On Incentives
* Communities, especially individualistic communities, have a neutral attitude towards turnover - this is bad
* Social turnover reduces the costs of defection, making it harder to commit to short and long-term plans
* We should treat turnover like in the business world, where it's seen as a cost to be minimized
* We are fortunate that rationality forms a subculture deep enough to build a community around, but we're wasting much of its potential
* The policy of pulling people to the Bay Area isn't very helpful for the people moving to the Bay Area, and destroys rationalist communities elsewhere
* The combination of the non-confrontational background social environment of Berkeley plus the social turnover in the rationalist community means that it's really difficult to give people uncomfortable but productive feedback

#### Economics: Time, Money, Spoons and Future Plans
* Living in Berkeley is *really expensive*
* This cost of living has second order effects which are damaging to the rationality community
    * People need high paying jobs
    * People need to devote significant amounts of mental energy to those jobs
    * Projects have to produce something that can be monetized in relatively short order
* Insane housing prices make it much more difficult for people to have a "normal" life (i.e. buying a house, having kids, etc.)

#### Culture: Not Taking The Sequences Seriously
* Everything that Bendini is talking about is mentioned as a pitfall in the original sequences
* However, the default path of every group is to ignore the literal interpretation of the text in favor of cultural zeitgeist

#### Recap
* So why did the rationality community go wrong?
    * Demographic factors formed multiple feedback loops that affected our ability to operate effectively
    * We chose to centralize in Berkeley, creating further negative feedback loops
    * We ignored the lessons of the sequences in favor of whatever insight porn was making the rounds at the moment

#### So What Is To Be Done?
* Berkeley is probably a lost cause
    * Too many demographic problems
    * If the software industry can't solve the demographic problems of the Bay Area, despite having a million times more resources than the rationality community, what hope does the rationality community have?
* Unfortunately, most other rationality hubs (Seattle, Boston, London) have the same problems

### The Craft And The Community: Resurrection

#### Intro
* To do better than Berkeley, we need better:
    * Demographics
    * Location - need slack to pursue rationality related projects
    * Culture - uphold rationalist principles

#### Demographics - Getting A Broad Range of Talents
* Recruit *undervalued* groups, rather than *underrepresented* ones
* Narrow the gender gap because we need help with recognizing and solving problems that can't be handled via logical analysis and writing code
* Women bring valuable skills in coordination and conscientiousness that the community currently lacks
* Focus on in-person recruitment
    * Introducing people to rationality related concepts is much easier in-person
    * People who attend meetups in person often have far better demographic characteristics than people who participate online
* Create better introductory materials
    * The Sequences are huge and aren't really of any practical benefit to new members
    * We need a relatively short guide to rationality that demonstrates immediate practical benefits in short order
* Discover the root causes for people leaving the community and address those
* Figure out the rationality community's value proposition for new members
    * If the only thing we have to offer is "interesting dinner party conversation", relatively few people are going to be willing to join
* 2 examples of demographics that we want to attract
    * Feminine/people-oriented women
        * Place greater emphasis on community-oriented norms
        * Tolerate stronger leadership - have figures who can make decisions and stand by them in the face of social pressure
        * Place greater value on female-coded interests and values (like teamwork)
        * Better onboarding/recruitment
            * Reduce inessential weirdness
            * Develop a message that appeals to people-oriented individuals
    * Already-successful people
        * Demonstrate clear value - show how the rationality community can improve life
        * Don't resent the disparity in success between the community and the person the community is trying to recruit
        * Create a community that is more than the social network of last resort for intelligent underacheivers, depressives and the socially clueless

#### Environment: Manchester Works For Us, We Don't Work For Manchester
* Why Manchester?
    * Low cost of living
    * Decent hourly wages and good job opportunities
    * Diverse range of industries
    * Good gender balance
    * English-speaking majority
    * Good background culture
        * Not too atomized
        * People living there "for life", rather than moving there merely for career goals
    * Good public transport system
    * Aesthetic beauty

#### Culture: More Productivity, Less Philosophy
* Create a culture that values effective work
* Need a benevolent dictator that prevents value drift
* Value decisiveness - executing an okay plan today is better than executing a perfect plan tomorrow

#### Conclusion
* Bendini is starting a project called *Kernel*, in Manchester
* This post is an effort to find kindred spirits to join him in that quest
