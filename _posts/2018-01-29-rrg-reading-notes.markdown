## [Different Worlds](http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/10/02/different-worlds/)
* Scott realizes that his experience with psychotherapy isn't anything like those of his colleagues
    * Scott's patients give calm and considered analyses of their problems
    * His colleague's patients all have emotional breakdowns
    * Scott's supervisor notes that he seems to be "uncomfortable with dramatic expressions of emotion", even when he's trying to hide that fact about himself
    * This means that Scott's lack of success with psychodynamic therapies may be due more to his own personality than the limitations of psychodynamic therapies themselves
* Paranoia and Williams Syndrome
    * Paranoia is a common symptom of many psychiatric disorders, most notably schizophrenia
        * The troubling thing about paranoia is how *gradual* it is
        * Instead of thinking the CIA is after you with mind-control rays, you'll just interpret ambiguous social signals in a slightly more negative fashion
        * This can lead to a self-reinforcing feedback loop, as you become more and more standoffish in response to perceived slights from others
    * Williams Syndrome is the opposit of paranoia
        * People with Williams Syndrome are "pathologically trusting" 
        * Completely incapable of believing that another person might lie to them or cause them harm
        * While it is usually coupled with mental retardation, IQ doesn't appear to have much of an impact on the severity of Williams Syndrome
        * It seems like threat detection is decoupled from conscious analysis
    * Psychiatric disorders are often the extremes of normal human variation
    * For every person who is diagnosed with Williams Syndrome there are probably a dozen who are just more "trusting" than normal
    * Our sense data is underdetermined
        * Each data point perceived by our senses can often be interpreted in multiple ways
        * This is true both of "low-level" sensory data, like vision and sound, and "high-level" data, like social cues
        * Most people are able to navigate this ambiguity by using "context", i.e. priors
        * However, these priors can and do vary from person to person, leading to differences in how two people will interpret exactly the same data
        * Just as there's a spectrum from introverted to extraverted, there may be a spectrum from paranoid to Williams Syndrome
* Bubbles
    * 46% of Americans are young-earth creationists
    * However, even though Scott isn't excluding people on the basis of politics, religion or class, he has approximately zero friends who are young-earth creationists
    * Some other bubbles that Scott lives in:
        * Transgender - people in Scott's bubble are 20x as likely to be trans as the general population
        * 2x as many Asians as the general population
        * Half as many African Americans as the general population
        * Depression, OCD and autism are overrepresented
        * Drug addiction and alcoholism are underrepresented
        * Programmers are overrepresented at 10x the Bay Area average
    * None of these bubbles were intentionally created
    * Some of these bubbles have persisted in the face of conscious efforts to break them
    * This phenomenon of bubbles is something that Scott thinks of when he meets serial abuse victims
        * Serial abuse victims are people who have been abused by multiple people, often over the course of their entire lives
        * Often abused by the person they turn to seek relief from their original abuser
        * Offensive explanation: serial abuse victims seek out abusers because they've internalized a model that defines an abusive relationship as "correct"
        * While this may be true of some victims, it doesn't seem to be true of many
        * Many go to great lengths to avoid abusers, but it doesn't seem to matter
        * Maybe they're stuck in a bubble of abusers, in the same way that Scott is stuck in a bubble of transgender computer programmers
* Discrimination
    * Some women in the tech. industry face a constant litany of harassment and discrimination, whereas other women go their entire careers without experiencing a single harassment event
    * Doesn't appear to be any correlation between industries, companies or physical attractiveness
    * Given the baseline rates of discrimination as reported, it's extremely statistically unlikely that someone would be able to go decades without being harrassed even once
* The two forces of self-selected bubbles and the ambiguity of social cues can combine to create different worlds for different people
    * People unconsciously self-select into bubbles
    * People vary in how they perceive social interactions
        * Discrimination is rarely as blatant (these days) as people being called out for their race or gender directly
        * There is usually some room for interpretation ("Was I being harrassed or discriminated against there?") which means that different people will perceive discriminatory experiences differently
    * Are people basically good or basically evil?
        * Some say the world is full of hypocritical backstabbers
        * Others say the world is full of basically decent people who are hampered by communications difficulties and differences of values
        * It's possible that both sides are correct because they see different slices of the world
        * This applies on many axes, not just good/evil
            * Are people basically rational or basically emotional?
            * Are people welcoming or shunning of outsiders
    * The concept of "privilege" gets part of the way there, but privilege has the limitation of insisting that these differences in experience have to line up along pre-determined categories like race, gender, or class
* Knowing that someone lives in a different world from you can go a long way towards making their behavior more comprehensible

## [The Narrative Fallacy and What You Can Do About It](https://www.fs.blog/2016/04/narrative-fallacy/)
* The narrative fallacy
    * Typical biographies start out by describing people's younger lives and try to show how their early lives would inevitably lead to their later success
    * Example: pretty much every sports biography has the same form:
        * Natural gift for the sport
        * Parent or coaches that pushed them to strive for excellence
        * Hard work ethic
        * Some kind of adversity or life-impacting event
        * We don't stop to ask ourselves why this person achieved this level of success when thousands of other people who have the same background were not able to
    * Narratives cause us to miss the influences of luck and timing
    * Narratives cause us to ignore the mathematical rules of probability - "Linda problem"
    * Narratives cause us to ignore regression to the mean
        * All success stories have a fair amount of luck in them
        * Eventually luck runs out and performance drops back towards the average
        * This doesn't mean that the person or organization is any worse than they used to be, only that they're not as lucky as they used to be
    * The problem with narratives is that we make them predictive, and by doing so, we make them seem more real than they actually are
* The reason-respecting tendency
    * People are willing to comply with those who give reasons, even when those reasons are absurd or meaningless
    * This is because reasons allow us to build narratives
    * This is why teaching that gives reasons for facts is so much more effective than rote memorization of the facts themselves
    * This means that our best teaching, learning and storytelling methods (those involving reasons and narrative) can also cause us to make our worst mistakes
* How do we help ourselves out of this quagmire?
    * Become aware of the problem
        * The key question to ask is, "Out of the population of X subject to the same initial conditions, how many turned out similarly to Y?"
        * "What other hard-to-measure causes may have played a role?"
    * Modern scientific thought is built on top of efforts to solve this problem
        * The notion of a hypothesis comes from the fact that people recognized that simple narrative explanations were not sufficient 
        * Narratives have to be experimentally tested before they can be accepted as "true" cause-and-effect relationships
    * Another question we can ask ourselves is, "Of the population not subject to initial conditions X, how many ended up with the results of Y?"
        * Which athletes had intact families and easy childhoods, but ended up in professional sports anyway?
        * Which corporations didn't follow the recommendations laid out in business books, but ended up successful anyway?
    * We can reduce our vulnerability to the narrative fallacy simply by consuming less narrative
        * Stop watching TV news
        * Be skeptical of biographies, memoirs and personal histories
        * Be careful of writers who claim to be writing facts, but are talented at painting a narrative
    * When making an important decision, write down why you made it ahead of time, and then go back to see whether your reasoning was correct
    * Favor experimentation over storytelling

## [What Universal Human Experiences Are You Missing Without Realizing It?](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/17/what-universal-human-experiences-are-you-missing-without-realizing-it/)
* Some people just don't have visual imaginations
    * Assumed that when other people where talking about visualizing objects, they were speaking metaphorically
    * Got so good at talking about these experiences in metaphorical terms that people with visual imaginations thought that people without visual imaginations were having visual experiences
    * Only when Galton conducted detailed surveys did he find out that there is in fact a broad variation in people's ability to form mental images
* Some people don't have the ability to smell (anosmia)
    * Can go for years without realizing that they don't have this ability
    * Often realize that they lack this sense when they're asked detailed questions about smells themselvesz
* So what other "fundamental" experiences are people missing out on
    * Asexuality - for most people, sex isn't gross or weird
    * Emotional blunting - while on SSRIs, Scott suspects that he might have no emotions or very little emotion
        * Just thought that everyone else was being dramatic and overexuberant
        * Even when he noticed himself not having emotions, he dismissed it as unlikely
        * Only learned later that emotional blunting is a common side-effect of SSRIs
    * Passion for music
        * Scott doesn't really enjoy jazz - at most gets a half-hearted tendency to want to snap his fingers to the beat
        * Meanwhile, his brother fell in love with jazz and is a professional jazz musician

## [Why You're Stuck In A Narrative](http://lesswrong.com/lw/14q/why_youre_stuck_in_a_narrative/)
* The narrative fallacy is our tendency to turn everything into a story
* The real world has very few examples of linear chains of cause and effect
* Most outcomes are probabilistic, direct causation is rare, and events are complex and interrelated
* Our brains are engins designed to analyze the environment, pick out important parts and extrapolate from there
* In the ancestral environment, simple linear extrapolation was good enough
* Unfortunately, the world is much more complex today
* The ability to cluster, simply and chain ideas is what allows us to get away with a relatively small working memory and relatively slow neurons
* The narrative fallacy shows up as a number of "lower level" biases
    * Availability heuristic - we make predictions based upon what we find easiest to remember, and what's easiest to remember is what has a compelling narrative around it
    * Hindsight bias - past events "obviously" and "inevitably" cause future ones
    * Consistency bias - we reinterpret past data to fit a narrative created by future data
    * Confirmation bias - we only look for information to confirm our pre-created narrative, not refute it
* However, we need a narrative in order to have a single coherent self
    * Patients with damage to their frontal lobe lose the ability to construct narratives
    * Lose the ability to organize their lives and actions 
    * In the extreme case, they do not speak unless spoken to and do not move unless very hungry
    * While people with other forms of neurological injury lose specific abilities, people who lose the ability to construct narratives lose their selves
* So how do we use narratives without falling into the narrative fallacy?
    * Make conjectures and run experiments
    * Force beliefs to be falsifiable
    * Make beliefs pay rent in anticipated experiences
