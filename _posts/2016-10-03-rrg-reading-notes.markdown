## Reading Notes

### [Waiting For BQP Fever](http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1767)
* High energy physicists don't feel the need to justify their research in the same way that quantum computing researchers do
* You can't always predict the benefits of pure science, so it's dangerous to justify the benefits of pure science on the basis of practical benefits
  * Expected benefits may not materialize
  * This leads to a loss of funding for the research
  * This may lead you to miss other, _unexpected_ benefits

### [The Salvation of Doug](http://www.sci.sdsu.edu/~smaloy/MicrobialGenetics/topics/genetics/doug.html)
* Just so story describing how a geneticist and a biochemist go about investigating biology
* Geneticist alters DNA and investigates how that affects the organism
* Biochemist investigates pathways and tries to describe mechanisms by which genetic information is translated into action
* [Part of a two-part debate between geneticists and biochemists](http://review.ucsc.edu/spring04/bio-debate.html)

### [Meaningness: An Appetizer: Purpose](https://meaningness.com/an-appetizer-purpose)
* People ask questions like:
  * Is there any purpose in living? Or is everything completely pointless?
  * What am I supposed to do?
  * How can I choose among the many ways to spend my life?
  * Does everyone's life have the same purpose, or does everyone have their own purpose?
  * Where does purpose come from?
* 5 confused attitudes towards purpose:
  * Eternalism:
    * Everything has a purpose
    * There is a grand cosmic plan
    * Problem:
      * The plan makes no sense
      * Even if the plan made sense, it's too vague - doesn't tell us what to do in particular situations
  * Nihilism
    * There is no purpose
    * Life is meaningless
    * Problem:
      * If life is meaningless, then what are we to do about the fact that people seem to crave purpose and meaning?
  * Materialism:
    * People have goals - those goals are their purpose
    * Family, wealth, fame, hedonism
    * Problem:
      * Rejects altruism and creative purposes
      * Purposes seem too "shallow"
      * Hedonic treadmill - there's always higher level of enjoyment that one can pursue
  * Mission:
    * Everyone has a unique gift
    * Find your unique gift and and use it to help others [_Ed: Isn't this literally the premise of My Little Pony?_]
    * Problem:
      * To quote _Fight Club_: "You are not special. You're not a beautiful and unique snowflake. You're the same decaying organic matter as everything else."
  * Existentialism:
    * The universe does not supply purpose, we have to find or create purpose for ourselves
    * Problem:
      * Creating purpose is hard
      * Impossible to create purpose independently of social influences

### [Half-Assing It With Everything You've Got](http://mindingourway.com/half-assing-it-with-everything-youve-got/)
* Guilt/shame motivation works great right up until it stops working
* If you want to be effective, remember your goals
* Accomplish your goals with a minimum of wasted effort - doing something _too well_ can be as wasteful as not doing it well enough, since it takes away time from you accomplishing the next thing
* You don't have enough energy or enough time to do everything perfectly - focus your energy on the things that you really care about and spend a minimum of effort on the other stuff
* Remember what your goals are; deploy your full effort towards reaching them with a minimum of wasted motion
