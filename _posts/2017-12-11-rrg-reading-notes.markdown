## [The Bummer Economy](https://putanumonit.com/2016/04/02/021_bummer/)
* The basic law of economics is that people respond to incentives
* Money doesn't need to be "real" to be a real currency
  * Money is a mutual promise by a group of people to do things
  * Currency is the mechanism by which we keep track of these promises
* Money works because people believe that promises to exchange to dollars for goods will be kept
* Any group of people who trust each other can establish their own currency and it will be just as effective
* Bummer points
  * Chores were assigned different amounts of 'bummer points'
  * Bummer points were kept track of in a publicly visible table
  * If more than one person volunteers for a chore, the volunteer with the fewest BPs get the chore
  * If no one volunteers for a chore, the person with the least BPs was assigned the chore
  * The relative popularity of chores allowed for the establishment of effective pricing
    * If there are not enough volunteers, increase the payout
    * If there are more than one or two people volunteering, decrease the payout
* The establishment of a leaderboard exerted social pressure on people to volunteer for chores
* Allowed people to load balance their work - do extra chores now to bank points against e.g. exam weeks
* Allowed people to leverage comparative advantage - people preferentially did the chores they hated the least
* Free trade economy sprung up -- people traded BPs in exchange for personal favors (like laundry)
* The simple act of introducing a currency resulted in miraculous results
* Money is magic and you don't need to be a central banker to be a wizard

## [Familiar Finance](https://putanumonit.com/2017/02/27/familiar-finance/)
* Most online financial advice is unanimous that loaning money to family or close friends is a bad idea
* Don't mention the downside of *not* borrowing from family
* Example:
  * Jacob's friend has $160,000 in student loans at 7% interest
  * His friend's parents held a similar amount in US Treasury Bonds paying 2%
  * By not loaning that money to Jacob's friend, his friend's parents were giving up something like $8000 a month in potential income
* When loaning money to people make it clear that it's not a gift or a favor
* Loans should always be a mutually beneficial arrangement
  * Always charge interest
  * Set a clear repayment schedule
  * Set provisions for early repayment and emergency deferral
* The main fear is that if your friends fail to repay the loan, you lose the money and the friendship
  * Don't treat lending money as a favor
  * Treat it as an investment and analyze the risk as if it were any other investment
  * Be prepared to lose the money the moment it's loaned
* Charging friends interests isn't exploitative
  * The loan can only exist if it's mutually benefical
  * Charging a non-zero interest rate doesn't mean you have to charge the same rates as a financial institution
  * You can do this because you have more information about your friend than the bank
* So does this mean that financial advice arguing against this practice is wrong?
  * Nope, it's almost completely correct
  * Loaning friends and family money requires a certain level of honesty, emotional maturity and financial sensibility
  * Most people don't have those pre-requisites
  * If you or your friends can't treat money sanely, keeping money away from personal relationships is good advice

## [Time Well Spent](https://putanumonit.com/2017/05/09/time-well-spent/)
* A popular topic among rationalist writers is *akrasia*
  * Akrasia is whatever in your head that prevents you from doing the stuff you wish you'd do
  * Catch-all term for:
    * Procrastination
    * Lack of willpower
    * Poor self-control
* Productivity advice comes in two flavors:
  * Scientific research on human motivation that's hard to turn into actual things to do to improve productivity
  * Anecdotal productivity tips that are often overcomplicated and contradictory
* Beeminder
  * Model of akrasia is that it's coordination between present-you and future-you
  * Beeminder tracks cumulative long-term goals and turns those into weekly sub-goals
  * Penalizes you financially if you fail to put a number on it
  * Prevents you from weaseling out of goals
    * The only way to avoid the penalty is to write an excuse note and send it to Beeminder
    * Automatic integration with other services (e.g. fitness trackers, Duolingo) to automatically maintain accountability
* After using Beeminder for many habits, entering data into Beeminder became a chore itself
* Create a single index that would track goals, fitness, education, social life and future plans
* Categorized activites and assigned positive, zero, or negative points to each category
* Established a goal of +30 points every week to force some productive activity every week
* Goal also forces a weekly review (another common productivity hack)
* Should you use this system? Not unless you're the sort of person who enjoys keeping detailed time logs

## [Strong Men Are Socialist, Reports Study That Previously Reported The Opposite](https://putanumonit.com/2017/05/27/strong-men-are-socialist-reports-a-study-that-previously-reported-the-opposite/)
* [Study](http://www.ehbonline.org/article/S1090-51381630390-7/fulltext) claims that physically strong men are more right-leaning whereas physically weaker men are more likely to left-leaning
* Sample group has issues:
  * Study claims that it sampled people between 18 and 40
  * In reality, 98% of the study was students between 18 and 21, with a single 40 year old male
* Study shows signs of extreme p-hacking
  * Two models
  * Two outcome variables
  * Six predictors
  * Several interactions
  * Several controls
* With that many hypotheses, it's virtually inevitable that some of them will be statistically significant with p < 0.05
* Authors don't correct p-values for the multiplicity of hypotheses tested
* In fact, with exactly the same data, it's possible to rewrite the article to prove the opposite hypothesis - that physically strong men prefer left-wing politics
* The power multiplicity is that it can "prove" any hypothesis you want it to
