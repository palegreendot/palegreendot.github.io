## [Religion's Claim To Be Non-Disprovable](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/fAuWLS7RKWD2npBFR/religion-s-claim-to-be-non-disprovable)
* In prior eras, people believed in religion on matters of fact in addition to matters of ethics
* Religion was seen as a source of accurate historical and scientific information
* However, as other, more accurate, institutions took over from religion on matters of history and science, religion retreated to only covering matters of ethics
* But why should we trust religion to be any more useful on matters of ethics than it was on matters of history or science?
* The notion of religion being a "separate magisterium" is a fallback position that is at odds with the way that religion was treated for most of human history

## [Professing and Cheering](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/RmCjazjupRGcHSm5N/professing-and-cheering)
* Dennett suggests that much of what is called "religious belief" should be called "religious profession"
* The question isn't why people believe a particular thing, but why they say they believe that thing
* There is another form of explicit belief that's more like cheering for a particular team or faction
* Many of the more ridiculous forms of explicit belief can be characterized more as cheering especially loudly for a particular side

## [Belief As Attire](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/nYkMLFpx77Rz3uo9c/belief-as-attire)
* Another form of belief is belief as group identification
* Belief, here, serves the same purpose as religious clothing - it's a way to indicate who is in the group and who is outside the group
* It's easy for someone to be passionate about group identification, even if they don't believe the things they're saying are literally true


## [Applause Lights](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/dLbkrPu5STNCBLRjr/applause-lights)
* There are words and phrases that act as "applause lights"
* Convey no meaningful content; just tell people that they ought to cheer (or boo)
* Most applause-light phrases can be detected by a simple reversal test - if reversing the phrase sounds abnormal or makes no sense, then the original phrase is probably an applause light
* While there can be legitimate reasons to say applaus-light-like sentences, such a sentence without meaningful specifics following is acting as an applause-light
