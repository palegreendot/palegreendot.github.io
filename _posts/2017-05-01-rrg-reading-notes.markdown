## [Not For The Sake of Happiness (Alone)](http://lesswrong.com/lw/lb/not_for_the_sake_of_happiness_alone/)
- Some ethicists argue as if happiness is the sole terminal goal that people have
- Should we care about the things that make us happy, apart from the happiness they bring?
- People do things that make them happy, but that doesn't mean that happiness is the only reason that people take actions
- For all value to be reducible to happiness, one must show that happiness is the only consequent of our decisions
- Eliezer's moral intuition requires that there be both an objective and a subjective component
	- A computer in an empty room producing art that no one will see has an objective component, but no subjective component
	- A pill that gives you the feeling of having produced a great scientific discovery, without actually producing that discovery has the subjective component, but not the objective component
- Eliezer also values freedom - the moral desirability of a future world is conditional on whether that world was arrived at by free choice or whether humanity was manipulated into choosing that world
- It's okay to have a value system with many terminal goals, none of which are reducible to one another

## [Fake Selfishness](http://lesswrong.com/lw/kx/fake_selfishness/)
- If you're genuinely selfish, you wouldn't be going around praising the virtues of selfishness
- You'd go around praising the virtues of altruism, benefiting from others' altruism while not being altruistic yourself

## [Fake Morality](http://lesswrong.com/lw/ky/fake_morality/)
- Most people have a pretty good sense of morals, which they then transfer onto a divine being
- The fact that religious people worry about losing their moral compass when they deconvert means that they have a moral compass that's their own
- If you fear God not punishing some deed that's immoral, then you have a moral compass independent of others
- You should use your own moral compass directly rather than proxying it through a divine being
- Losing your faith doesn't mean that you lose your sense of moral direction

## [Fake Utility Functions](http://lesswrong.com/lw/lq/fake_utility_functions/)
- Human utility functions are known to be complex
- If you design a superintelligent AI that leaves out even one of the terms in humans' utility functions, then you risk hyper-existential catastrophe
- People devising utility functions for AI often drastically oversimplify humans' utility functions and then try to show that their AI meets the standard of being perfectly moral
- The only thing that can produce a moral AI is human morality
- Simplified human morality is not the same as human morality
- If you're not encoding human morality into your AI, you're risking confusing means for ends

## [Detached Lever Fallacy](http://lesswrong.com/lw/sp/detached_lever_fallacy/)
- The trigger for a mechanism (lever) is not the same as the mechanism itself 
- Biological responses to the environment are mediated by genetics
- Conditional responses are always more complex than unconditional responses
	- It's easier to put in unconditional niceness than it is to make the AI nice conditional on it having imprinted on human culture
- Putting an AI in a human culture will not guarantee that the AI develops human morality
