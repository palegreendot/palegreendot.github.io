## [Wait Culture vs. Interrupt Culture](http://lesswrong.com/lw/j5n/wait_vs_interrupt_culture/)
* Many people think it's normal to interrupt
* However, interruption is a social norm
* Consciously avoiding interruptions can be a much better mode of communication
* Pauses are an opportunity to reflect on what has been said
* Trust the conversation itself over individual participants
* Wait culture is more "civil" and allows people more time to think before they respond
* Interrupt culture is more robust in "real world" circumstances, where we're forced to compete for priority

## [Interpretive Labor](https://acesounderglass.com/2015/06/09/interpretive-labor/)
* Interpretive labor is the work that you do to understand and contextualize the actions of others in terms of their norms and values
* It is also the work that you do to make your actions understandable to the norms and values of others
* Interpretive labor flows up the status gradient -- it is less privileged people who are supposed to be doing the interpretive labor to "fit in" with the social norms of the more privileged
* A large part of the anger around trigger warnings and cultural sensitivity comes from the fact that they're asking people with greater privilege to perform interpretive labor
* We need to take into account interpretive labor when we perform charity
* If we're not careful, the additional interpretive labor that we require of the recipients of our charity can diminish or even overwhelm the benefits provided by the charity itself

## [Ra](https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2016/10/20/ra/)
* Ra is a name given to a personification of the tendency to stockpile more resources than you can possibly consume
* Ra is about generic superlativity - having "the biggest, the bestest and the most"
* Ra is about prestige
	- Being an "insider", even when that status can't be cashed out for money or favors is Ra
	- Ra is seeing institutions as "more real" than the people who comprise the institutions
* Ra defends itself with vagueness, confusion, incoherence and then anger
	- Excessive use of jargon without fully understanding what the jargon means is Ra
	- When challenged, a Ra point of view collapses into angry nihilism
* A Ra perspective leads to people getting offended when people do things for reasons other than money and power
* Ra is when you think that others are "insiders" in a way that is impossible for you to figure out
* Ra hates communication and introspection
	- Ra is the feeling that people who are mysterious and unknowable are somehow better than people who are easy to model
	- Ra promotes the idea that optimal politeness involves hiding as many preferences as possible
	- Ra hates specificity and concreteness, on the reasoning that being specific about things robs them of their sacredness

## [The Copenhagen Interpretation of Ethics](https://blog.jaibot.com/the-copenhagen-interpretation-of-ethics/)
* Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics
	- The actual spin of a particle is in a superimposed state until it is observed
	- Observing reality fundamentally changes it
* Copenhagen interpretation of ethics
	- If you observe or interact with a problem in any way, you can be blamed for it
	- At the very least, you can be blamed for not doing more
* Separating "noticing the problem" from "doing something about the problem" makes it much easier to work on big problems without getting overwhelmed

## [Theory of Change](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/theoryofchange)
* Work backwards from the goal in specific, concrete steps
* Figure out exactly what people's incentives are, and how to change those incentives
