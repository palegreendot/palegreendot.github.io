## [The Use and Abuse of Witchdoctors for Life](https://samzdat.com/2017/06/19/the-use-and-abuse-of-witchdoctors-for-life/)
- Paper: _[Why Being Wrong Can Be Right: Magical Warfare Technologies and the Persistence of False Beliefs](https://raulsanchezdelasierra.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/nunn_sanchez-de-la-sierra_aerpp_2017.pdf)_
- Summary: 
  - Bullet-proofing magic (gri gri) is relatively common in sub-Saharan Africa
  - This bullet-proofing magic does not work - if you get shot while wearing gri gri, you will still be shot
  - So why does belief in gri gri persist?
  - Belief in gri gri lowers the barriers to collective action, and makes more people in the village fight to defend it
  - Therefore, due to group selection, villages with belief in gri gri survive and thrive, whereas villages without belief in gri gri die out
- Look at the phenomenon from the perspective of the state:
  - In the absence of a scientific paper explaining why a belief in gri gri is beneficial, people would characterized gri gri as "stupid" or "irrational"
  - Even with the paper, modernizers might look for ways to preserve the benefits of gri gri without its harmful elements
  - The problem is that there's no way to isolate gri gri from the broader worldview that holds faith in village elders and witch doctors
- This illustrates a more important general concept: *metis* is both *actions* and *worldview*
- You cannot change the actions without altering the worldview
- Altering the worldview necessarily changes the actions
- Economics and politics doesn't consider individual psychological states
  - Efficiency, money, goods, are only valuable insofar as they make people more happy
  - The problem is that it's a lot easier to optimize for money, goods, etc. than it is to optimize for happiness
  - Therefore, we optimize for those things far beyond the point to which they bring additional happiness (and indeed to the point where they start reducing happiness)
  - People join institutions for psychological reasons, and the material benefits those institutions bring are a happy side-effect
  - Not all customs that increase psychological happiness improve people's economic productivity
    - Those customs are selected against by market economies
