## [A Sense That More Is Possible](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2c/a_sense_that_more_is_possible/)
* Why should anyone be motivated to learn rationality?
* Rationalists don't seem that much happier or more successful than non-rationalists
* There ought to be a discipline of cognition that makes its students perceptibly more successful and formidable
* Rationalists need to come together and come up with a systematic program to improve cognition
* How do you systematically test rationality programs and verify that they're making people more rational?
* Why aren't rationalists surrounded by a visible aura of formidability?
  * Less systematic training
  * More difficult verification
  * Easier to convince people of the benefits of physical strength than it is to convince people of the benefits of rationality
* People lack the sense that rationality should be trained like a martial art
* [Possible counterpoint](https://palegreendot.net/rrg_notes/2017/07/16/rrg-reading-notes.html#critical-thinkingttpwwwaftorgsitesdefaultfilesperiodicalscritthinkingpdf)

## [Epistemic Viciousness](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2i/epistemic_viciousness/)
* Epistemic viciousness proliferation of mystical beliefs that occurs after a discipline is divorced from real-world feedback
* How does epistemic viciousness arise?
  * The art is seen as sacred
  * People become emotionally attached to certain techniques
  * Incoming students have no choice but to trust the teacher
  * Excessive deference to historical masters
  * Inability to test new methods or innovations (or verify the accuracy of existing techniques)

## [Schools Proliferating Without Evidence](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2j/schools_proliferating_without_evidence/)
* There is no statistical difference in outcomes among different types of psychotherapy
* Yet, there is a proliferation of schools and movements in psychotherapy
  * Proliferation occurs despite lack of experimental evidence
  * Occurs because the easiest way to gain prestige is to found a new movement
* If you're going to create an organized practice of anything, you need to come up with a way of determining how well you're doing in a replicable and statistically rigorous fashion

## [Three Levels of Rationality Verification](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2s/3_levels_of_rationality_verification/)
* How do we verify our ideas on how to improve?
* Three levels:
  * Reputational
  * Experimental
  * Organizational
* Reputational - idea is verified in real world tests, preferably against other ideas
* Experimental - idea is verified by statistically rigorous tests
* Organizational - idea is made difficult to game or fake

## [Why Our Kind Cannot Cooperate](http://lesswrong.com/lw/3h/why_our_kind_cant_cooperate/)
* Why is it that flying saucer cults are better at coordination than rationalists?
* Flying saucer cults can use a number of unhealthy techniques to enforce cooperation
* This tends to make them lose touch with reality
* Is there a way to cooperate while retaining an accurate view of reality?
* The lack of cooperative success among rationalists highlights the fact that the current rationalist canon is oriented towards individual rationality, rather than group rationality
* Tolerating only disagreement is as irrational as tolerating only agreement
* You should never do worse with more knowledge
* Need to be more tolerant of strong emotions
* Need to be more tolerant of the idea of sacrifice
