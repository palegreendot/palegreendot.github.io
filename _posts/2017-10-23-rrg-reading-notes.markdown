## [Intellectual Progress Inside and Outside Academia](https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/xQ9tMMk3RArodLtDq/intellectual-progress-inside-and-outside-academia)
- Initial Thread:
  - Wei Dai:
    - Discussion is about what is preventing academia from recognizing certain steps in intellectual progress
    - Why didn't academics come up with Bitcoin or TDT
  - Eliezer Yudkowsky
    - Academic system doesn't promote "real work"
    - Trying to get productive work done in academia means ignoring all of incentives in academia pointing against productive work
    - People who have trouble seeing the problems with academia are blinded by: 
      - Inadequate fluency with [Meditations On Moloch](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/)
      - Status blindness
      - Assigning non-zero positive status to being in academia
    - Can we get academics to take the non-academic work being done by MIRI, et. al. seriously?
      - OpenPhil hasn't been very good at getting research done on AI alignment
    - The obvious strategy is to not subject yourself to academic incentives
      - Abandon peer review (by academics)
    - Mailing lists work better than journals
- Subthread 1:
  - Wei Dai
    - Academia has delivered deep and important results
    - We need a theory that explains why academia has been able to do certain things but not others (or maybe why the situation has deteriorated)
    - We should be worried that academia is not able to make progress on AI alignment
  - Qiaochu Yuan
    - Is it correct to speak of academia as a single entity?
  - Wei Dai
    - What distinguishes the parts of the academia that are productive from the parts that are not?
    - Is the problem that academia is focusing on the wrong questions?
    - How can we get academia to focus on higher priority topics?
- Subthread 2:
  - Eliezer Yudkowsky
    - Things have gotten worse in recent decades
    - Maybe if we had the researchers from the '40s, we'd do better
    - OpenPhil is better than most funding sources, but they don't "see past the pretend"
    - Most human institutions don't solve particularly hard mental problems
  - Rob Bensinger
    - It's not actually clear that the researchers from the '40s would do better given current knowledge
    - Progress in quantum mechanics has proceeded similarly with progress in AI
    - Academics were talking about AI alignment as a potential problem as far back as 1956
  - Wei Dai
    - Maybe human brains and the tools of the 20th century are just bad at philosophical issues
    - We see a slowdown in all fields because we're waiting on philosophical breakthroughs
    - AI happens to be more affected by this slowdown than other fields
  - Rob Bensinger
    - Prior to 1880, human inquiry was good at exploring nonstandard narratives, but bad at rigorously demanding demanding testing and precision
    - Between 1880 and 1980 we solved the problem by requiring precision and testing, which allowed science to get a lot of low-hanging fruit really fast
    - But the problem with requiring precision and testing is that it prevents you from exploring "weird" problems at the edge of your conceptual boundaries
    - The process of synthesizing "explore weird nonstandard hypothesis" with "demand precision and rigor" is one that's progressing in fits and starts
- Subthread 3:
  - Vladimir Slepnev
    - Why isn't Nick Bostrom excited about TDT/UDT?
    - Academia has a tendency to go off in wrong directions, but its direction can be influenced with understanding and effort
  - Wei Dai
    - What are some examples of academia going off in the wrong direction and getting corrected by outsiders?
  - Vladimir Slepnev
    - It's easier to influence the direction that academia goes in from the inside
  - Maxim Kesin
    - The price of getting into academia at a level high enough to influence the direction of a field is very high
  - Wei Dai
    - There's a subset of the steps in each field that need to be done by outsiders or newcomers?
  - Vladimir Slepnev
    - Doesn't understand the hate against academia
  - Wei Dai
    - People on LessWrong understood UDT just fine - why can't academics get it
  - Vladimir Slepnev
    - Academia hasn't accepted TDT/UDT because it hasn't been framed correctly
- Subthread 4
  - Stuart Armstrong
    - The problem is both specialization and lack of urgency
    - People found the paper about "interruptible agents" interesting, but not necessarily significant
    - The paper was helpful, however, to help him learn how to model and to present ideas
    - MIRI doesn't tell people why they should care about why topics or results
- Subthread 5
  - Eliezer Yudkowsky
    - Most big organizations don't do science
    - Most big science organizations aren't doing science, they're performing rituals that look like science

## [Research Debt](https://distill.pub/2017/research-debt/)
- Achieving a research-level understanding of most topics is like climbing a mountain
- This climb isn't progress, it's debt
- The Debt
  - Poor expostion - bad explanations of an idea
  - Poor abstractions and notation
  - Noise - no way to know which research papers you should be looking at
- Interpretive labor
  - Tradeoff between the energy used to explain an idea and the energy required to understand it
  - Many-to-one communication imposes a multiplier to the cost of understanding because everyone receiving the idea has to understand it for him or herself
  - Specialization occurs because the cost of understanding increases as the number of people communicating increases
  - Research debt is the accumulation of missing interpretive labor
- Clear Thinking - need better abstractions and notations
- Research distillation
  - Need to make ideas understandable to people outside of a given field
  - Requires deep scientific understanding, empathy, and design
  - As labor intensive as coming up with the original discoveries in the first place
- Where are the distillers?
  - No incentives to support distillation
  - Distillation work isn't seen as "real research"
- An ecosystem for distillation
  - Distill Journal - venue to give traditional recognition to nontraditional contributions
  - Distill Prize - $10,000 prize to acknowledge outstanding explanations of machine learning
  - Distill Infrastructure - tools for making beautiful interactive essays

## [Rereading Kahneman's Thinking Fast and Slow](https://jasoncollins.org/2016/06/29/re-reading-kahnemans-thinking-fast-and-slow/)
- _Thinking Fast and Slow_ is great but it isn't perfect
- Studies haven't held up in the replication crisis
  - *Kahneman himself has reduced his [support for priming research](https://replicationindex.wordpress.com/2017/02/02/reconstruction-of-a-train-wreck-how-priming-research-went-of-the-rails/#comment-1454)*
- Hot hand effect appears to be real 
- Organ donation rates
  - It's much more difficult to opt-out of organ donation in countries that have organ donation by default
  - Not a checkbox on the license form
- Prospect theory seems to be as unrealistic as perfect rationality and is much less mathematically tractable

## [Devoodoofying Psychology](http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/08/25/devoodooifying-psychology/)
- Voodoo death
  - People dying after being cursed by witch doctors
  - Even if magic isn't real, if people believe in magic they'll waste away out of fear
  - The problem with voodoo death is that it seems plausible, but there isn't any evidence for it
- A lot of psychological phenomena look pretty voodoo
  - Placebo effect
    - Voodoo effect in reverse
    - Intially people were claiming all sorts of benefits to placebos
    - New studies show that placebo effect is weak and largely limited to controlling pain
  - Stereotype threat
    - If people think that others think they'll do bad on a test, they'll actually do worse
    - Doesn't replicate well in large studies
  - Self-esteem 
    - Popular in the mid-90s
    - Failed to replicate in later studies
  - Name preference effect
  - Unconscious social priming
  - Artificial surveillance cues don't increase generosity
  - Implicit association tests mostly don't work
- Common thread in all examples: shift away from the power of the unconscious
- Maybe our conception of the unconscious overly broad

## [Learning To Love Scientific Consensus](http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/04/17/learning-to-love-scientific-consensus/)
- Most scientific "mavericks" were either doubted for a short period of time or were part of moderate-sized dissenting movement
- After a few years (between 10 and 30) their contributions were recognized
- While scientific consensus may be flawed, it doesn't ignore contrary evidence for long periods of time
- Replication crisis
  - Scientists take the replication crisis pretty seriously
  - Took about 10 years to go from something that only a few people were talking about to something that the mainstream consensus took seriously
  - Rationalists were ahead of the curve, but not that far ahead
- Nutrition
  - Most nutrition scientists don't believe in the old paradigm of all calories being equal and fat being bad for you
  - If the old paradigm continues to be popular, it's because of inertia in the media and popular culture
- Social Justice
  - There have been meta-analyses showing that Implicit Association Tests aren't a good test for bias since 2009
  - Problems with stereotype threat have been covered in the mainstream media
  - While there are authors arguing against gender differences, they're not considered to be part of the scientific consensus anymore
  - The psychological consensus includes genetic psychological differences between population groups
- Nurture assumption and blank-slatism
  - It took about 10 years for people to realize that genetics confounds studies of developmental outcomes
- Intelligence explosion and AI risk
  - Many AI researchers take the notion of AI risk seriously
  - While the scientific consensus hasn't shifted wholly in favor of taking X-Risk seriously, it's no longer completely against X-Risk
- IQ
  - Most expert psychologists and applied psychologists agree that IQ measures cognitive ability and are culture neutral
  - Even when people disagree with IQ, their disagreements seem to be limited and well-reasoned
- The process of trying and discarding ideas is the process by which science progresses
- Scientific consensus has been accurate to an almost unreasonable degree
- That said, we shouldn't overly respect scientific consensus
  - The only reason that consensus ever changes is because people look for evidence against the consensus, and then present it
  - It's really easy to be misinformed about what the consensus is
