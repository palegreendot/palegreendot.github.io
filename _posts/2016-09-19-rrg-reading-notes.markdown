## Reading Notes

### [Desire Is The Direction, Rationality Is The Magnitude](http://mindingourway.com/desire-is-the-direction-rationality-is-the-magnitude/) - Nate Soares

* Sterotype: rationality is about removing "hot", emotional reasoning and replacing it with "cool", calculated reasoning
* Makes people uncomfortable
* Emotional reasoning is a core part of humanity and people feel like they're giving up a portion of their humanity by being asked to give up emotional reasoning
* The reality is that rationality focuses on the reasoning, rather than the kind of reasoning
* The core aim of rationality is making you better at acheiving your goals, rather than telling you what your goals should be

### [What Sort of Thing a Brain Is](http://mindingourway.com/what-sort-of-thing-a-brain-is/) - Nate Soares

* A brain is a specialized device that takes in information from the outside world and changes its internal state in response
* But that's not the only thing it does:
  * Planning
  * Prediction
  * Consciousness
* The brain is far from a perfect information processing machine
* There is no homonculus sitting inside the brain - the brain is all there is
* Rationality is about making the brain better at building up an internal representation of the outside world

### [Ephemeral Correspondence](http://mindingourway.com/ephemeral-correspondance/) - Nate Soares

* Sometimes the brain updates its model of the world automatically, but sometimes it allows the mind to choose how the model gets updated
* This is deeply troubling
  * Why should the part of the brain responsible for making decisions based upon the model of the world have any say at all in how the model is built?
* Sometimes it takes conscious effort to acknowledge evidence and update your world-model
* Rationality is about putting in that effort to make your mental model of the world have a closer correspondence to how the world is

### [The Brain/Mind Distinction](http://mindingourway.com/the-brainmind-distinction/) - Nate Soares

* The brain is not the mind
* The mind is implemented by the brain 
* The mind is part of the brain, but not the only part
* Changes in the focus of our awareness are the result of changes in the brain's model of the world 

### [The Way of the Rationalist](http://mindingourway.com/the-way-of-the-rationalist/)

* On the path to rationality, there are no beliefs, only probabilities
  * Believing the hypothesis that has the balance of probability in its favor leaves you open to being proven "wrong" by chance
* Stop thinking in terms of what will/won't happen, but instead think of what will probably happen
* Try to keep multiple probable outcomes in your mind simultaneously
* This is difficult, which is why we should practice it
* Replace qualitative intuition with quantitative intuition




## Discussion Notes

### Lightning Talks

#### Rohit - Colors and How We See Them
* Nate states that perceiving the sky as blue is one of the instances where the brain updates its model automatically, free of outside influences
* This is false - even the perception of something as fundamental as color is culturally influenced
* 3 examples
  * Ancient Greeks - never used the word blue 
    * Homer describes people has having violet eyes
    * "Wine-dark seas"
  * Himba Tribe of Namibia
    * Don't have separate words for green and blue
    * Both colors are described the same word
    * Have trouble distinguishing between blue and green swatches - [study](http://research.gold.ac.uk/5673/1/PSY_davidoff-robertson-color-categories_2005.pdf) by Roberson, Davidoff et. al.
  * Davidoff's daughter
    * Professor Davidoff carefully avoids teaching his daughter that the sky is blue
    * Points at sky and asks her what color it is
    * Response: "white"
* The presence of categories enhances our ability to see distinctions between objects in different categories
* Categories are historically and culturally determined
  * For color, the invention of these categories appears to correspond with the invention of dyes - "blue" is a relatively young category because blue dye is more difficult to make
* Himba, ancient Greeks and Davidoff's daughter all have different categories for color than the Western mainstream, so in a sense they do see colors differently
* Same light hitting the retinas is interpreted differently by the brain

#### Eric - How Sailboats Work
* All sailing is an exercise in applied Newtonian mechanics
* Wind pushes against sail
* Sail pulls on boat
* Water pushes against boat in the opposite direction
* Sailboats are able to sail at an angle to the wind by exploiting Newton's third law
  * Mount sail on a pivot
  * Rotate sail such that it's perpendicular to the wind, but at an angle to the boat
  * Wind pushes on sail
  * Equal and opposite force from water pushing on boat
  * Boat moves relative to water at a different speed and direction that it moves relative to the wind
    * This is fine - you don't care about crossing a wind, but you do care about crossing the ocean
* The role of the keel in a boat is to keep the boat from sliding sideways through the water 
* Triangular sails are especially handy, since they are easier to rotate - easier to match changes in the wind, easier to reposition for changes in desired course

#### Ben - Brainstorming 
* To effectively brainstorm, set two timers
* Write down ideas and explore problem space in first timers
* Think of solutions and prune ideas in second timer
* Helps prevent you from getting fixated on a particular idea or solution

### Reading Discussion

#### Desire Is The Direction, Rationality Is The Magnitude
* Rationality is a means, not an end
* Yudkowsky's definition of rationality, which Soares is using, doesn't disentangle intelligence and rationality
* Is intelligence a multiplier for rationality?

#### What Sort of Thing a Brain Is
* Purpose of this essay to show _why_ we need rationality
* Brain isn't a special, different thing
* Part of the body and subject to many of the same flaws of biology and evolution
* Human brains are weird, compared to animal brains
  * Can hold a much broader set of relatively arbitrary information
  * Allows for memes to move around between brains - semi-separate memetic ecosystem

#### Ephemeral Correspondence
* Effort needed to make your mind correspond to reality - this is not something that happens automatically
* Agree with conclusions of essay, but think that the argument could be improved
* Don't agree with Nate's use of the word "executive" - ascribes executive function to many things that we don't have conscious control over

#### The Brain/Mind Distinction
* Largely a restatement of _What Sort of Thing a Brain Is_
* Consciousness is a part of the brain, not king of the brain

#### The Way of the Rationalist
* Can we actually think in terms of probabilities at a System 1 level - Kahneman doesn't seem to think so
* Perhaps the best we can do is be aware of situations where our intutions towards certainty aren't good approximations and prime ourselves to use System 2 in those situations
* Assigning probabilities of 0 and 1 may not be mathematically accurate, but is a useful mental shortcut for computing approximations
