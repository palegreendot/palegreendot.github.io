## Reading Notes

### [Ask And Guess](http://lesswrong.com/lw/375/ask_and_guess/)
* Ask culture vs. guess culture:
  * Ask culture: socially acceptable to ask, equally acceptable to refuse
  * Guess culture: determine ahead of time if your request is appropriate
    * Rude to make requests that are excessive or inappropriate
    * Rude to refuse requests that are appropriate
  * People tend to be systematic askers or systematic guessers (possibly influenced by culture)
  * Ask vs. guess is also situational 
    * Generally, the higher stakes the social situation, the more we lean towards guess culture
* If you're a guesser, when should you ask more?
  * Failure/rejection is so common that it's not shameful
  * You're asking someone whose job it is to handle requests
  * Granting/refusing a request is easy
* _Are there situations where we should err more towards guess culture?_

### [Tell Culture](http://lesswrong.com/lw/jis/tell_culture/)
* Tell the other person the state of your mind
* Interpret responses as attempts to create common knowledge rather than requests or presumptions of compliance
* The burden of honesty is even higher with Tell Culture than it is with Ask Culture
* Requires near complete trust between people
* _How do you bootstrap this?_

### [Reveal Culture](http://malcolmocean.com/2015/06/reveal-culture/)
* Why are Ask, Guess, Tell, etc called _cultures_, and not strategies
  * Shared assumptions - you can't just declare Tell Culture and unload your internal state on the other person
  * Ask Culture - assumptions of trust:
    * I trust that you'll ask me if you want something
    * You trust that I'll be able to refuse if I'm not able or willing to give you what you want
  * Guess Culture - assumptions of trust:
    * I trust that you'll be able to read my body language and respond appropriately
    * You trust that I'll offer indirect cues before responding, so that you can calibrate your requests/responses accordingly
  * Reveal Culture:
    * When you share information with me, I trust that you're doing so honestly and because you think that it will be helpful
    * When I share information with you, I'm trusting that you can process it, even if it's difficult to hear
    * The second part is very important
* So what about Tell Culture?
  * Tell Culture is a variant of Ask Culture
    * Ask culture + strength of preference in request
* What experiences are people having with Tell Culture
  * People are having Tell Culture thrust upon them rather than being in a situation where there's mutual agreement
  * Like "having Crocker's rules thrust upon you"
  * Seems like this is especially traumatic for people coming from Guess Culture
* Reveal Culture, has as a prerequisite, positively correlated models of interpersonal engagement
  * Does not work if engagement is a zero sum game
  * No sociopaths
  * No narcissists
* Why Reveal Culture
  * Speaks to vulnerability of everyone involved
  * Less imperative than Tell Culture (you can tell someone to do something, but you can't reveal someone to do something)
  * Evokes image of careful sharing

### [Against Tell Culture](https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2015/05/08/against-tell-culture/)
* The difference between Tell, Ask and Guess is how much subtext is involved
* Tell Culture tries to remove subtext from communication entirely
  * Not possible
  * Not even desirable
* Lots of human interaction is more about subtext than it is about the object level interaction
  * Flirting, for example
* It's impossible to disentangle value judgements from certain facts
  * If you tell someone that you don't trust them, it will always carry a subtext of, "And you're a bad person," whether you want it to or not
* Tell Culture is the death of plausible deniability
  * You can't tell someone you want to do something, you also have to tell them why you want to do it

### [Against Being For or Against Tell Culture](http://agentyduck.blogspot.com/2015/05/against-being-for-or-against-tell.html)
* Ask, Guess and Tell cultures are all very broad categories, meant as a first approximation for a variety of communication styles
* You should learn how to communicate effectively no matter which culture you're coming from
* Identify what you what to do with your communication and tailor it to your audience's expectations

### [Why You Should Maybe Keep Your Crush a Secret](http://www.theferrett.com/ferrettworks/2014/02/why-you-should-maybe-keep-your-crush-a-secret/)
* Telling someone that you're romantically interested in them puts an obligation on them
* They don't have a good mental model of you
* They don't know how you're going to react to being rejected
* Especially problematic for women
* Not every attraction needs to be followed up on
* Look for signals that they might be interested in you before you confess your crush to them
