## [Making Beliefs Pay Rent (In Anticipated Experiences)](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/a7n8GdKiAZRX86T5A/making-beliefs-pay-rent-in-anticipated-experiences)
* Beliefs should have consequences
* Beliefs should constraing future experiences
* Empiricism is the process of asking what experiences our beliefs predict and, more importantly, which experiences they prohibit
* When arguing about beliefs, ask about what you would expect to observe as a result of those beliefs
* If you can't find the difference, you're arguing about what you should put on the label for a particular experience, not the experience itself

## [A Fable of Science and Politics](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/6hfGNLf4Hg5DXqJCF/a-fable-of-science-and-politics)
* Science fiction parable in which people have been driven from the Earth's surface
* Have no idea what the sky looks like - only knowledge comes from books that describe the sky as "cerulean"
* Debate arises as to whether cerulean is a shade of blue or a shade of green
* This debate takes on political dimension and leads to violence
* As a result, the question of whether the sky is blue or green isn't a simple question about color - it's entangled with many other social and economic beliefs
* One day, there's an earthquake and a path to the surface opens up
* What happens next depends on who travels that path
    * Aditya (blue): sees the color of the sky as vindication for all that the blue faction has fought for - decides to end the truce between blue and green
    * Barron (green): sees color of the sky as proof that the universe is evil
    * Charles (moderate blue): sees knoweldge of the color of the sky as dangerous - vows to come back and seal up the path
    * Daria, (green): forces herself to look at the sky and change her mind, even though it's hard and painful
    * Eddin, (green): struck by the pointlessness of so much conflict over such a simple question
    * Ferris - just notices the color and proceeds to explore the rest of the surface world

## [Belief In Belief](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/CqyJzDZWvGhhFJ7dY/belief-in-belief)
* It's often much easier to believe that one ought to believe something than it is to actually believe that thing
* People often claim to believe something even when they don't anticipate the experiences that are entailed by that belief
* These people often make excuses to pre-emptively explain away experimental results that contradict the beliefs they profess to hold
* In many ways, people who genuinely believe something are easier to convince because you can debate them with evidence and find concrete points of disagreement

## [Bayesian Judo](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/NKaPFf98Y5otMbsPk/bayesian-judo)
* Eliezer encounters someone who asserts that Artificial Intelligence is impossible because intelligence requires a soul and only God can create souls
* Eliezer replies that this means that if he can create an Artifical Intelligence, it means this person's religion is false
* Person attempts to retreat by saying that they were referring to emotional experiences
* Eliezer replies by saying that if the AI appears to have emotional experiences, it proves the religion wrong
* Person says that they might have to agree to disagree
* Eliezer uses Aumann's agreement theorem to assert that rationalists cannot agree to disagree

## [Pretending To Be Wise](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/jeyvzALDbjdjjv5RW/pretending-to-be-wise)
* Many people signal wisdom by refusing to pass judgement
* There is a real difference between suspending judgement and asserting that every point of view is equally valid
* There is a real difference between skepticisim and relativism
    * Skepticism is doubting a particular answer, but acknowledging that there is an answer to be found
    * Relativism is thinking that all answers are equally valid in some sense
* Neutrality is a judgement too; refusing to choose sides is a choice in itself
* There is a difference between passing neutral judgement and refusing to pass judgement
* Pretending that either of the above is a mark of deep wisdom that sets you ahove everyone else is folly
