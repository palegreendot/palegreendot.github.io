## [Ethical Injunctions](http://lesswrong.com/lw/v1/ethical_injunctions/)
* Ethical injunctions are things you shouldn't do even if you believe they're the right thing to do
* Never try to deceive yourself or believes something other than what is probably true. It's more likely that you've made a mistake than found the one case in which a false belief is more helpful than a true belief
* Believing something false is a black-swan bet. Even if it works out most of the time, the one time it doesn't work out can undo all the gains you got from winning the bet
* Your brain is corrupted hardware - you will always believe that your calculations are correct, even if they're way off
  * So why compound the errors by choosing to believe something that you know is probably not true?
* Spreading falsehoods for the greater good can backfire really badly
  * Truth is always easier to make consistent than falsehood
* When people "rationally" abandon ethical principles, it always seems to be that they go towards greater ethical leninence, rather than greater ethical strictness

## [Something To Protect](http://lesswrong.com/lw/nb/something_to_protect/)
* Rationality must have purpose, otherwise it collapses into infinite recursion
* Rationality is about being more effective at achieving your goals
* "Truth" is too abstract a goal - too easy to claim that you're defending truth when you're defending superstition
* Requiring beliefs to yield predictions and then testing those predictions brings us much closer to truth than trying to reason out what's true on our own
* Rationality is not about choosing only methods that are guaranteed to work
  * Rationality is about embracing the hard math of probability and being willing to at least look at the conclusion of that math, even if it's considered "morally repugnant"
* Part of the aesthetic of rationality is subordinating rationality to a higher purpose - treat rationality as a means, rather than an end

## [When (Not) To Use Probabilities](http://lesswrong.com/lw/sg/when_not_to_use_probabilities/)
* If you don't know the probability of something, don't make up a number for the sake of having a number
* Everything has a probability, but that probability may be too difficult to compute
* In those case, we should avoid making up numbers to give ourselves a feeling of having more information than we actually do
* If you find an inconsistency in your model of the world, patching your model to be consistent doesn't necessarily make it more accurate
* Example numbers may be helpful, but don't confuse those example numbers with true probabilities
* Counterpoint from Slate Star Codex: [If It's Worth Doing, It's Worth Doing With Made Up Statistics](http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/02/if-its-worth-doing-its-worth-doing-with-made-up-statistics/)

## [Newcomb's Problem and the Regret of Rationality](http://lesswrong.com/lw/nc/newcombs_problem_and_regret_of_rationality/)
* Setup:
  * Box A: Transparent, contains $1000
  * Box B: Opaque, may contain $1,000,000 or nothing
  * Superintelligent being Omega offers you a choice: 
    * Box B only ("one-box")
    * Box A and Box B ("two-box")
  * Omega chooses the boxes before you're offered the choice - neither you nor Omega can alter the contents of the boxes
  * Everyone who has chosen the two-box strategy has found that Box B is empty
  * Everyone who has chosen the one-box strategy has found Box B to contain a million dollars
  * Which box should you choose?
* Causal decision theory says that you should two-box, even though everyone who has taken the two-box strategy has had a worse outcome
* "It's not your fault that Omega chooses to reward irrationality"
* However, rationality is about winning
* Omega doesn't care the reasoning by which you come to your decision
* You don't have to have a "good reason" for choosing Box B, you only need to choose Box B
* Instead of starting with a "rational" decision theory and then saying that Omega rewards irrationality, we should start by looking at the outcomes and then come up with a decision theory that ensures that we'll choose the best outcomes
* Rationalists should never envy the choices that nonrationalists make - there is nothing stopping us from making the same choices

## [Tsuyoku Naritai! (I Want To Become Stronger)](http://lesswrong.com/lw/h8/tsuyoku_naritai_i_want_to_become_stronger/)
* The important thing is to make progress
* Never take pride in your ignorance; take pride in the work that you do to remedy your ignorance
