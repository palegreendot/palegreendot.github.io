## [Should Considered Harmful](http://mindingourway.com/should-considered-harmful/)
* The word "should" puts us in direct and unnecessary conflict with ourselves
* Saying "should" immediately removes the direct motivation for a task and turns it into an obligation
* If you start to fail at a task that you "should" be succeeding at, you panic, and that only makes the failure worse
* Think through every alternative branch, even the ones where you fail
	- You don't have to convince yourself that failure is okay
	- Thinking about failures makes scenarios concrete
	- Concrete scenarios are easier to reason about and guard against
* Keep a tally of whenever you use the word "should"
* Restate your obligations without the word "should"

## [Not Because You "Should"](http://mindingourway.com/not-because-you-should/)
* Stop doing things because you "should"
* "Should" is not a basis for motivation
* Find the real reasons for performing actions
* If you can't find a reason beyond "should", maybe you don't need to perform the action
* The best way to become an altruist is to have a genuine desire to help, not a "should"-based moral obligation

## [Your "Shoulds" Are Not A Duty](http://mindingourway.com/shoulds-are-not-a-duty/)
* Objection: If we put our wants on the same scale as our moral obligations, we might make the "wrong" choice
* If it's possible for your wants to override your moral obligations, then maybe they're not really your moral obligations
* There is not external authority telling you that you should do things
  * "Should" comes from within
* A real moral commitment doesn't even feel like a choice - the right thing to do is "obvious" and you go do it

## [Working Yourself Ragged Is Not A Virtue](http://mindingourway.com/stop-before-you-drop/)
* There is a pernicious belief that it is unvirtuous to stop working if you're physically able to continue
* Your goal is to maximize the integral of productivity, not the derivative
	- Slowing down can be helpful if it allows you to work for longer
* Your body and mind are limited resources; they need to be used as wisely as anything else

## [Rest in Motion](http://mindingourway.com/rest-in-motion/)
* The work that needs to be done is not a finite list of tasks, it is a neverending stream
* The goal is to move through the work, to do things
* Inaction is boring - the ground state for most people is an active one, not a passive one
* The actual reward state for most people isn't one where you're doing nothing, it's one where you're doing the things that you *want* to do, rather than things you *have* to do
* Rest when you need to rest, not when you've run out of work to do (hint: you'll never run out of work to do)
* Instead of thinking of your work in terms of lists (which are finite), think about your work in terms of streams (which are not)
* Divide your work up into streams (rest is a stream too) and consume tasks from each stream at the rate that you can do them
* Do what needs doing at a sustainable pace
