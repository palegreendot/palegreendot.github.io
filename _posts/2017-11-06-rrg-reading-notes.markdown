## [Gears In Understanding](http://lesswrong.com/lw/ozz/gears_in_understanding/)
- One way to evaluate a model is to look at how deterministically interconnected its components are
- How do you know whether a model has deterministically interconnected components?
  - Is the model falsifiable?
  - If the model were falsified, how precisely could you infer other things from the falsification?
  - How incoherent is it to imagine a single variable changing within the model?
  - If you knew the model were accurate, but you forgot one of the variables, would you be able to rederive the missing information?
- Example: gears in a box
  - If you have gears in an opaque box, your model is not deterministically interconnected - knowing how the input gear turns gives you little or no ability to predict the output gear
  - If the box is transparent, it's much easier to make predictions about the output
- Example: arithmetic
  - There is a tension between memorizing the usage of an algorithm and understanding how an algorithm really works
  - We should define "understanding" as a student's ability to re-derive missing parts of an algorithm from their knowledge of other parts of the algorithm
- Example: Valentine's Mother
  - If Valentine tells you that their mother likes history, that's a random disconnected fact
  - But to them, their mother's enjoyment of history can be derived from other facts that they know about their mother
  - Valentine's model of their mother has more deterministically interconnected pieces than ours does
  - Models can be viewed on a continuum between collections of random facts and axiomatic systems where everything can be logically derived
- Example: gyroscopes
  - Most people think that gyroscopes behave in a non-intuitive fashion
  - Most people have a model of the world in which it's coherent to imagine that physics works exactly as it actually does, except when you drop a gyroscope, it falls like a non-spinning object
  - The nice thing about physics is that everything is interconnected - falsifying even a small piece of the model leads to updates everywhere else
- Interconnectedness is not the same as goodness
  - If you have a model that has more disconnected components, but also generates better predictions, use that
  - Most of our models don't connect all the way down to physics, so it's all right if not every part of your model can be derived from base axioms
- Insisting that models be interconnected and deterministic is a powerful tool for cutting through confusion

## [In Praise of Fake Frameworks](http://lesswrong.com/lw/p80/in_praise_of_fake_frameworks/)
- Valentine uses a lot of models that are "obviously wrong" in some way
- Examples of "fake frameworks"
  - Distinction between extroverts and introverts
  - MBTI personality types
- An ontology is a set of "basic" elements that you use to build a model
  - "Point", "line" and "plane" are the ontology of Euclidean geometry
  - "Mass", "position" and "time" are the ontolgy of Newtonian mechanics
  - People get confused when they switch ontologies without noticing
  - The MBTI personality traits can form a useful ontology, even though they don't directly correspond to parts of personality
- It's a type error to say that ontologies are either correct or wrong
  - The ontology itself can neither be correct nor incorrect as those are facts that only apply to the models that you build from the ontology
  - The concept of *ki* in aikido can be useful even though it has no direct correspondent in physics
- Try different ontologies, even if you know that they've been used to build incorrect models

## [The MTG Color Wheel](https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/KbaJsfBtdpGv7EKbC/the-mtg-color-wheel)
- Magic: The Gathering (MTG) colors form an ontology of personality types and motivations
- MTG has 5 colors, arranged in a wheel, each with its own characteristics
  - White - peace through order
    - Coordination, cooperation and restraint are the key to ending suffering in the world
  - Asks what is the *right* action to take, where "right" is defined by some moral or cultural framework
  - Blue - perfection through knowledge
    - Figure out the truth and apply that truth to the fullest extent
    - Asks, "What course of action makes the most *sense*?" - "sense" is determined by careful analysis and expertise
    - Seeks to change the rules, rather than just applying the rules
  - Black - satisfaction through ruthlessness
    - Desires *agency* - the ability to shape the world
    - Asks, "What will leave me best off?"
    - Amoral, rather than immoral - moral considerations are secondary to power considerations
  - Red - freedom through actions
    - Seeks the ability to live in the moment
    - Asks, "What do I feel like doing?"
  - Green - harmony through acceptance
    - Most suffering comes from trying to fix things that aren't broken
    - Color of Chesterton's Fence
    - Asks, "How are things usually done? What is the established wisdom?"
- Colors disagree with those that are across the wheel from them
  ![Magic: The Gathering Color Oppositions](/assets/2017-11-06/mtg_color_oppositions.png)
  - White prioritizes the group over the individual
  - Black prioritizes the individual over the group
  - Green sees the environment as something to be cherished and preserved
  - Black sees the environment as a resource to be exploited
  - Green sees genetics and environment as being determinative, while blue believes in transcending one's origins
  - Blue sees red as impulsive and rash, while red sees blue as repressed and unfeeling
  - Red and white disagree on structure and commitment
- Colors ally with those that are adjacent to them on the wheel
  ![Magic: The Gathering Color Alliances](/assets/2017-11-06/mtg_color_alliances.png)
  - White and blue agree on the importance of structure
  - Blue and black agree on the importance of personal growth
  - Black and red agree on the importance of independence and agency
  - Red and green agree on the importance of authenticity
  - Green and white agree that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts
- Although opposite colors are nominally opposed, it's still possible to combine them
  ![Magic: The Gathering Color Opposite Combinations](/assets/2017-11-06/mtg_color_contrasts.png)
  - Black and white combine to form tribalism
  - Blue and red form creativity
  - Black and green form Darwinian ethics - a belief in the virtue of struggle and the notion that whatever emerges from that struggle is virtuous
  - Red and white are the colors of heroism - a belief in what's right combined with the willingness to go outside existing power structures to accomplish it
  - Blue and green are the colors of truth-seeking
    - Both blue and green seek to know the world as it is
    - Blue wants to know the world as it is in order to change it
    - Green wants to know the world as it is to make peace with it
- So what do we do with the color wheel?
  - Classify things and make predictions
  - Colors give you associations that can bias your predictions in useful ways
  - Colors only represent goals and means, not morality - every color is good in some ways and evil in others
  - Assigning colors to people can help you understand their motivations and their worldview

## [On Types of Typologies](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/27/on-types-of-typologies/)
- Meyers-Briggs Type Indicator
  - Inconsistently applied
  - Unscientific
  - Yet why does Scott consistently recognize himself as an INTJ?
- MBTI can be both unscientific and a useful tool
- Factor analysis shows that there are 5 traits, only one of which corresponds with an MBTI type
- Five-Factor and MBTI are trying to do different things
  - Five-Factor is trying to break down personality into mathematically precise components for research purposes
  - MBTI is trying to separate people into categories that are easy to think about
- Even the poorly drawn categories of MBTI can be useful
