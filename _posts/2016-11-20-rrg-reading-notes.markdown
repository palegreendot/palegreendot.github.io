- "Compulsive behavior" is an umbrella term that can refer to both substance addiction and other repeated unwanted behaviors
- What is compulsive behavior
  - Can't stop
  - Results in net-negative consequences
  - Prevents you from doing the things that you want to do
  - Note that behavior that you feel bad about, but isn't causing you trouble otherwise isn't necessarily compulsive behavior
- 2 approaches:
  - Harm Reduction:
    - Reduce consequences of compulsive behavior
    - Make sure that relapses cause as little harm as possible
    - Planning for harm reduction can be difficult if you're trying to abstain
    - Plan for what to do after relapse
      - How are you going to deal with feelings of guilt and shame w/o bingeing?
      - How do you keep a slip from turning into a disaster

- "Weaponized weakness"
  - Express needs through passive-aggressive self-flagellation
- One can still contribute to relationship problems without overt aggression
- One major reason that conflicts escalate is because both sides feel like they have to exercise their right to respond
- "Do you want to be right or do you want to be happy?"
- Takes courage to de-escalate
- Imagine how you'd react if a stranger behaved this way towards your loved one - now why are you behaving in the same way?
- Look back over the past three or four arguments and ask yourself what you did to make things worse
- Identify your emotional triggers
  - Anticipate what you'll do when (not if) your partner hits them
  - Plan your response
  - Figure how to resist the urge to escalate the situation
  - Remember your goal: to not make things worse
- Once you've separated yourself from the conversation, use crisis survival skills to deal with the pain

### [Changing Emotional Responses](https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2015/11/05/changing-emotional-responses/)
- After you've identified the emotion that you're feeling, ask yourself, "Does it make sense?"

- Can we get people to be happy by changing their distorted thoughts?
  - Not all cognitive distortions make people unhappy
  - Not all unhappy interpretations result from distorted thinking
- 6-step process of checking the facts
  - Figure out which emotion you want to change
  - Describe the event prompting the emotion as factually as possible
  - Describe your interpretations, thoughts and assumptions
  - If you feel there's a threat, label the threat
  - If the threat happens, what's the worst case scenario that could result
  - Does your emotion's intensity, duration and type fit the facts?
- If your emotion does fit the facts, you need to apply problem solving skills
  - The problem is the situation, not your emotional response to it
- If your emotion does not fit the facts, you need to do apply "opposite action"
  - Think about the thing that you most want to do
  - Do the opposite of that
  - Keep doing it
  - You don't have to like it, just do it anyway
  - Opposite action will work, but it will also feel like the hardest thing in the world
