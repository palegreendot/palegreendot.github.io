## Reading Notes

### [DBT Sequence: Assumptions](https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2015/08/06/dbt-sequence-assumptions/)
- People are doing the best they can
- No one sets out to do harmful or self-destructive things
- There's always a reason behind thoughts, feelings and behaviors
  - You don't always know that reason
- So why do people behave in self-destructive ways?
  - Ignorance / lack of skills - don't know how to handle the problem
  - Inaccurate beliefs
  - Constraints
- There is no guarantee that doing your best is enough to get by in the world
- Telling yourself to stop doing stupid stuff is remarkably ineffective
- The goal of DBT is to figure out why you're doing stupid stuff and then use that to come up with a way of not doing it
- Behaviors and skills are context sensitive
  - Just because you can accept criticism at work doesn't mean that you can do so at home
  - Just because you can set boundaries with your friends doesn't mean you can set boundaries with your parents
- You cannot control the things that other people do
- However, you can control your own behavior and this will influence how other people will act towards you

### [DBT Sequence: Dialectics](https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2015/08/08/dbt-sequence-dialectics/)
- The core dialectic (the dialectic in dialectic behavioral therapy) of DBT is acceptance vs. change
- People need to accept who they are
- People also need to change their behaviors
- This seems like a paradox
- However, notice that self-acceptance is, in many instances, a pretty big change

### [DBT Sequence: Chain Analysis](https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2015/09/06/dbt-sequence-chain-analysis/)
- Chain analysis is a technique for finding the cause of the behavior that needs to change
- Describe the behavior that you want to change
  - Describe it in as much detail as you can
  - Write it down
- Describe what prompted the behavior
  - Why did you do this thing today rather than yesterday?
- What made you vulnerable to the behavior
  - Eating/sleeping poorly
  - External stresses
- Describe in as much detail as you can the chain of events that connected the prompt to the behavior
  - Actions as well as feelings
- Describe the consequences
  - Especially describe the *positive* consequences of the behavior
  - You wouldn't be doing the thing you wish to change unless there was something you were getting out of it
- Look at the chain of events and for each step in the chain, describe a mitigation
- Look at vulnerabilities described in step 3 and comes up with ways to avoid making yourself vulnerable
- Come up with ways to repair the consequences of what you did

### [DBT Sequence: Crisis Survival](https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2015/09/08/dbt-sequence-crisis-survival/)
- Crisis: situation that you cannot immediately solve
- Not something that happens every day
- Goal: get you through the immediate stress and carve out time and mental energy to deal with the crisis in a constructive fashion
- **STOP** - what you do when you notice you're in crisis
  - *Stop* - don't do anything; take a break
  - *Take* a step back
  - *Observe*
  - *Proceed* mindfully
- **Pros/Cons**
  - Write down your options
  - List the good and bad outcomes of every option
- **TIPP** - strategies to lower arousal
  - Lower *temperature* - splash some cold water on your face, rub an ice cube on your forehead, etc.
  - *Intense* exercise - burn off excess energy
  - *Paced* breathing
  - *Paired* muscle relaxation
- Distract yourself
  - **ACCEPTS**
    - *Activities* - do something to get your mind off what's bothering you
    - *Contributions* - do something for someone else
    - *Comparisons* - compare yourself to others to make yourself feel better
      - High variance strategy - may or may not work in your circumstance
    - *Emotions* - trigger a different emotion
      - Listen to some angry music
      - Watch a scary movie
    - *Pushing* away
      - Visualize the thing that's causing you distress
      - Now put it in a box
      - Now put that box on a shelf
      - Easy to overuse - put the thing on a shelf, but remember to deal with it at some point
    - *Thoughts*
      - Do some mental activity that takes your mind off the problem
      - Useful if you're not actually able to remove yourself physically from the situation that's causing you distress
      - Can be as simple as counting in your head
    - *Sensations/self-soothing*
      - Curl up in a blanket
  - **IMPROVE**
    - *Imagery*
      - Visualize a peaceful/safe environment
      - Tell yourself a story
    - *Meaning*
      - Find some sort of purpose for your suffering
    - *Prayer*
      - Praying for strength can work
      - Praying to have the thing that's causing you distress removed doesn't work
    - *Relaxation*
      - Take a deep breath
      - Focus on noticing tense muscles and consciously relaxing them
    - *One* thing in the moment
      - Focus on whatever you're doing right now
      - Don't regret the past
      - Don't worry about the future
      - Try to induce a flow state
    - *Vacation* 
      - Take a *short* break from whatever you're doing
    - *Encouragement*
      - "Positive" self talk
      - Doesn't have to be the standard, peppy encouragement you hear from others

### [DBT Sequence: Radical Acceptance](https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2015/09/15/dbt-sequence-radical-acceptance/)
- Remember the [litany](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Litany_of_Gendlin)<br />
  What's true is already so<br />
  Owning up to it won't make it worse<br />
  Not being open about it doesn't make it go away<br />
  And because it's true, it is what is there to be interacted with<br />
  Anything untrue isn't there to be lived<br />
  People can stand what is true<br />
  For they are already enduring it<br />
- What isn't radical acceptance:
  - Denial
    - Pretending that the problem isn't there
    - Pretending that proven-ineffective tactics applied one more time will cause the problem to go away
  - Tantrums
    - Asking "why me"
    - Getting mad at the world
- How do you practice radical acceptance?
  - Notice yourself not accepting reality
  - Tell yourself that you're going to accept reality as it is
  - Plan what someone else would do in your situation and then carry out the plan (fake it 'til you make it)
  - Let the recoil (e.g. feelings of anger and hopelessness) wash over you and then proceed with your plans anyway
  - Willingness vs. willfulness
    - Willingness
      - Active participation in reality
      - Doing the best given circumstances
    - Willfulness
      - Trying to fix everything
      - Giving up
      - Attachment to desires
  - Notice avoidance
    - Try to feel that flinch in your brain when you avoid something
    - Mindfulness helps with this
