## [Ugh Fields](http://lesswrong.com/lw/21b/ugh_fields/)
* If you're getting constant negative conditioning via unhappy thoughts, you'll develop a reflexive aversion to the subject of those thoughts
* Ugh fields don't start out as a flinch -- start with real, but minor negative consequences
* Negative consequences cause you to develop flinch
* Flinch makes you worse at the thing, which leads to more negative consequences
* Eventually you have trouble doing the thing at all, as your subconscious has taken over making it difficult to even think about the topic
* At this point it's like the object or activity has developed a repulsion field around it - this is the Ugh Field
* Result of temporal difference learning
  * Associate psychological pain with earliest stimulus that led to the pain
  * Engage in displacement activity rather than doing the thing that causes psychological pain
* Possible antidotes
  * Look for the flinch response -- mindfulness
  * Visualize how much better your life would be without the Ugh Field getting in your way
  * Identify your reactions, write them down, and try to put some distance between yourself and your unconscious reaction

## [Rubber Duck Debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)
* Explain your problem, in as much detail as you can to a rubber duck and often the solution will just pop out at you
* Sometimes, forcing yourself into the outside view is all it takes
