## [Empathy Gaps - Introduction](http://joshuaspodek.com/js_blogseries/empathy-gaps-series)
* An empathy gap is the when you think you'll feel a certain way when you're planning an activity and you feel something completely different when you're performing the activity
* Example: Making a commitment to go to the gym every day, but then skipping out going because you're busy or feeling lethargic
* Figuring out how to overcome empathy gaps is an important step in being able to fulfill long-term commitments

## Part 1: One of the most insidious barriers to getting things done
* When you feel one emotion you generally can't conceive of your motivations when feeling a different emotion
* When you plan to do something, you general feel positive emotions. When you act on those plans and encounter obstacles, you feel negative emotions
* These negative emotions can run counter to and override your goals
* This difference between feelings during planning and feelings during execution is the empathy gap
* Examples:
  * Trying to rush through a hot shower on a cold morning
  * Trying to stick to a diet while surrounded by rich foods
  * Talking to someone who consistently makes you angry, and trying to avoid an argument
  * Trying to wake up quickly when tired
* The common thread with all of these scenarios is that your values outside of the situation are different from your values inside the situation
* We think our values are much more immutable than they actually are

## Part 2: Research and Experiments
* Not only does judgement change, but people can't predict that their judgement will change
* Examples:
  * Sexual arousal: people drastically underestimated their willingness to forego safe sex precautions when they were aroused
  * Physical pain: people drastically underestimated the effect that physical pain would have upon their cognitive skills, both before and after pain was applied
  * Bullying: people underestimated the effect that being ostracized had on them, both before and after the ostracism
* People have a hard time understanding how people in other emotional states feel, even when those other people are past or future versions of themselves
* People imagine that other people need less motivation than they actually do

## Part 3: Why Empathy Gaps Make Sense
* Empathy gaps are to be expected given the following model of the emotional system:
  ![emotional model]({{site.url}}/assets/2017-02-13/empathy_gap_model.jpg)
* Emotions depend on environment, perception, and behavior
* If the environment changes, then our perceptions change, which then changes our emotions and motivation

## Part 4: Overcoming Empathy Gaps
* Awareness
  * Expect empathy gaps
  * Try to imagine how you'll feel when you're in the environment in which you're taking the action and plan accordingly
* Experience
  * If you've ever overcome an empathy gap before (even if it was in a different context), try to replicate the effect
* Learn from others
* Change your environment
  * Can you change your environment so that the environment in which you're doing things is more like the environment in which you're planning?
* Change your beliefs
  * Awareness affects you through perceptions, which are filtered by beliefs
  * Can you change your beliefs so that environmental stimuli have a different effect?

## Examples of Empathy Gaps
* Teenagers and pregnancy
* Power corrupting
* Empathy gaps can be used to one's advantage
  * It can be easier to plan going to the gym, and then doing exercise once you're there than it is to plan to exercise
  * Avoiding unhealthy foods is a lot easier if you add to the empathy gap by putting the food farther away
* Living in a totalitarian regime
  * Most people don't think that they'd go along with the actions of a totalitarian regime, yet most do
* Aging
  * People can't appreciate the motivations and lives of people significantly older than themselves

## Hard Projects Will Be Harder Than You Expect: How To Prepare
* Intellectual antcipation of difficulty does not prepare you for the emotional motivation to stop that you'll feel when you encounter obstacles
* Hot-cold empathy gap → Hard to anticipate how you'll react in the heat of the moment ahead of time
* Empathy gaps require willpower to overcome, and the best strategy is to minimize the number of empathy gaps so that you can apply maximum willpower to each one

## A Model That Explains Why Your Enthusiasm When Planning Disappears When Doing
* Emotions react to what you perceive in the moment → when moment changes, motivation changes
* When you're planning, you're thinking more about the end product than the steps required to get there
* Strategies to deal with empathy gaps:
  * Know about the effect
  * Observe and learn from empathy gaps in others
  * Build on experience
  * Change your environment
  * Change your beliefs
