## Reading Notes

### [Interpersonal Effectiveness: Introduction](https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2016/01/20/dbt-interpersonal-effectiveness-introduction/)
- Interpersonal effectiveness:
  - Relationships
    - Asking for what you want
    - Set boundaries
    - Making new relationships
    - Fixing relationships
    - Changing relationships
    - Ending relationships
  - All kinds of relationships are included, not just romantic relationships
- People often have interpersonal effectiveness in some areas but not others
- What interferes with being interpersonally effective
  - Not having the right skills
  - Lack of knowledge of one's own wants and needs
  - Being overwhelmed by emotion
  - Forgetting long-term goals/values
  - Environmental blocks - other people have autonomy and there is no magic sequence of words you can say to make them do what you want
  - Believing myths about human interaction
- If you catch yourself believing one of the myths, don't judge yourself. Instead ask yourself what evidence led you to believe that myth.

### [Interpersonal Effectiveness: Obtaining Objectives Skillfully](https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2016/02/24/interpersonal-effectiveness-obtaining-objectives-skillfully/)
- Everyone has needs that can be met by other people
- 3 goals in any interaction
  - Objective - get the thing that you want to get
  - Maintain the relationship
  - Maintain self-respect
- Know what your priorities are with regards to the above before going into any particular conversation
- "Assertiveness" is shorthand for knowing your priorities and acting in accordance with them
- DEAR MAN GIVE FAST - set of strategies to get objectives, maintain relationships and self-respect
- DEAR
  - **Describe** the current situation, leaving out emotion
  - **Express** your feelings and emotions about the situation
  - **Assert** your request or refusal
  - **Reinforce** - describe rewards or consequences for the other person if they give you what you want
    - Make sure negative consequences are proportional
- MAN
  - **Mindful** - keep focused on your goals and don't get sidetracked
  - **Appear** confident - pretend that you are an effective competent adult
  - **Negotiate** - know what you are and are not willing to compromise on
- GIVE
  - **Gentle** - don't be deliberately mean or insulting
  - **Interested** - pay attention to what the other person is saying
  - **Validate** - show that you understand the other person's needs or concerns
  - **Easy** manner - don't be unnecessarily serious
- FAST
  - **Fair** - be fair to yourself; it's okay to want things
  - **Apologies** - don't apologize unless you've done something to apologize for
  - **Stick** to your own values
  - **Truthful** - in general, lying doesn't help
- Intensity 
  - Figure out what level of intensity is most appropriate for the request
  - Not necessarily the same level of intensity as your emotions
  - Dime game - way to figure out if you're being too intense or not intense enough
- Troubleshooting (if you're in a fight) 
  - Don't use the word "obvious" or anything like it (if it were really obvious, you wouldn't be in this situation)
  - Start by describing the current interaction without motives
  - After that, you can describe your desire for the interaction to end
  - If you're asking for something, suggest that you'll come up with a better offer later
- Checklist of common obstacles to interpersonal effectiveness
  - Emotions getting in the way of skills
  - Not knowing which skills to use
  - Not knowing or remembering your objective
  - Worrying too much about short term concerns and neglecting long-term needs
  - Unexamined assumptions and myths about interactions and about the other person
  - Environmental factors - maybe it's not actually possible to get what you want and you need to radically accept that

### [Interpersonal Effectiveness: Building and Ending Relationships](https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2016/02/25/interpersonal-effectiveness-building-and-ending-relationships/)
- Building relationships
  - To a first approximation, all people are worthy of friendship
  - Mere exposure effect - more likely to make friends with people you're around a lot
  - Try to find people who are similar to you, but make sure they're *actually* similar
  - Talk to people even if you're worried that you'll come off as weird or creepy
  - Ask questions and respond to questions with just a bit more information than the person asked for (but only a bit)
  - Small talk isn't evil
  - Compliment people, and try to be non-obvious in your compliments
  - How to join a group at a social gathering
    - Find a group that looks "open"
    - Approach person you know or the most friendly looking person
    - Greet them and ask if you can join
  - Reciprocity
    - A good guideline for building and maintaining a relationship is to mirror the other person's invitations at a delay
  - Be mindful
    - Observe - pay attention purposefully
    - Describe - separate fact and interpretation
    - Participate - be engaged; avoid self-hate
    - One-mindfully - do one thing at a time
    - Effectively - remember your values and your goals
- Ending relationships
  - First try to fix the relationship with DEAR MAN GIVE FAST
  - Never end a relationship when you're overcome with emotion
  - Be direct and don't blow up when you're ending a relationship
  - Avoid reminders of the relationship that you've ended

### [DBT: Walking the Middle Path](https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2016/03/09/dbt-walking-the-middle-path/)
- DBT is all about balancing opposites
- More than one side to any given situation
  - People have reasons for doing things
  - People can disagree and still be correct
  - Ask yourself why the other person is behaving in the way that they're behaving
- I am human and nothing human is alien to me
  - Humans are far more similar to each other than they are different
  - Try to understand other people even if you don't agree with them
- The only thing that doesn't change is change
  - Nothing is constant
  - Plan for change
  - Change is transactional - we influence our environments and our environments influence us
- Validation
  - Find the grain of truth in other people's experiences
  - People are more reasonable when they've been validated
  - Acknowledgement does not imply agreement
  - Can validate facts, experiences or difficulties
  - How to validate:
    - Pay attention
    - Reflect back - restate the other person's argument
    - Try to figure out what they're thinking, keeping in mind that this is just a guess on your part
    - Try to understand why the other person is thinking what they're thinking
    - Given the above, try to reason out why the other person's response is logical
    - Don't try to one-up the other person
  - You don't always have to validate; invalidation can be important too
    - Correct or not, invalidation is painful
    - Do five validating things for every invalidating thing
    - Sometimes you have to radically accept that you've been invalidated and move on
  - Validating yourself can be as important as validating others
- Behavioral Change
  - To acheive behavioral change, reward behavior in stages
  - Start by rewarding behaviors all the time, then back of to intermittent reinforcement
  - If someone is doing something that you don't want them to do, ask yourself if you're inadvertently reinforcing that behavior
  - Punishment can be used as a last resort
    - Should be or appear to be a natural consequence of the behavior
    - Should be proportionate

### [Avoid vs. Accept](https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2016/03/17/avoid-vs-accept/)
- When there's something scary, you can avoid it, or you can face it
- The latter is usually better
- Courage is acknowledging when you're afraid and then proceeding anyway

### [With Borderlines, Validate, Don't Reassure](https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2016/03/30/with-borderlines-validate-dont-reassure/)
- When interacting with someone who has BPD, validate their emotions rather than trying to respond to those emotions
- Try to find the grain of truth behind what they're doing
- Reassure them that feeling the emotion that they're feeling is okay
