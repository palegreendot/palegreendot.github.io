## [Authentic Signals](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2017/11/authentic-signals.html)
* To say that people do things for signalling value is not contrary with saying that people do things because of authentic desire
* People draw a distinction between signalling as conscious intent and signalling as a secondary consequence of authentic desires
* Society disapproves of conscious signalling
* However, the consequences of a behavior are the same, regardless of whether it was done with conscious intent or not

## [The Best and the Brightest](http://sudoscript.com/the-best-and-the-brightest/)
* Allegorical story describing the process of getting an education and a job as a series of levels in a game
* "Maze of Tests" - grade school
  * Advance by giving the right answers
  * Realize that you can advance more quickly by [guessing the teacher's password](http://lesswrong.com/lw/iq/guessing_the_teachers_password/)
  * However, being able to advance more quickly in this fashion doesn't make you smarter
* "Swamp of College Admissions" 
  * Need to hire a test-prep guide to get you through one of the three-letter exams
  * Need to come up with a good story about how you have potential to benefit society
  * However, even though you've come up with a good story, it doesn't mean you're actually benefiting society
* Once in college you need the "magic smoke of the right names" in order to get a good job
  * Interning at a well-known company gets you an advantage even if you didn't really do any challenging work
  * Need to put the right names on your resume in order to get a good offer
* Once in the workplace, you need the "magic rope of right relationships" to advance
  * Find your higher-up's deepest fears and insecurities
  * Play politics to advance
  * However, the fact that you're advancing doesn't mean you're more deserving
* The "Inside game"
  * Notice that "insiders" have a fast track to the top of the social hierarchy
  * Take the insiders' route to the top, bypassing all the real work done by others to advance
* Once you get to the top, you realize that there are no "true" answers
* The real game is setting the rules of the game for everyone else

## [Play in Hard Mode](https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/08/26/play-in-hard-mode/)
* "Hard mode" means accomplishing goals in a manner that ensures personal growth
* Deliberately eschew trying to make yourself look better than you are
* "Hard mode" is about being true to your own values, even if they run contrary to what society expects

## [Play In Easy Mode](https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/08/26/play-in-easy-mode/)
* "Easy mode" is analyzing systems and finding the most efficient path to your goal
* Easy mode strategies can fall victim to [Goodhart's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law), where you optimize the narrow thing that society expects of you while losing site of your broader goals and values
* Easy mode can get you to certain goals faster, but doesn't build character
* Easy mode is "selling out"

## [Half-Assing It With Everything You've Got](http://mindingourway.com/half-assing-it-with-everything-youve-got/)
* Guilt/shame motivation works great right up until it stops working
* If you want to be effective, remember your goals
* Accomplish your goals with a minimum of wasted effort - doing something _too well_ can be as wasteful as not doing it well enough, since it takes away time from you accomplishing the next thing
* You don't have enough energy or enough time to do everything perfectly - focus your energy on the things that you really care about and spend a minimum of effort on the other stuff
* Remember what your goals are; deploy your full effort towards reaching them with a minimum of wasted motion
