## Reading Notes

### [Richard Feynman: Cargo Cult Science](http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/2/CargoCult.htm)
* We have lots of things that appear scientific, but hardly produce results in the real world
* This is especially true in the social sciences
  * Education
  * Criminal reform
  * Psychotherapy
* All of the above are examples of _cargo cult science_
* Comes from the notion of cargo cults in the South Pacific
  * Pacific Islanders see strange people come in and build runways
  * Then airplanes come down with all sorts of fantastic things
  * So the native islanders build things like runways and set up fires to resemble runway lights, and even arrange for a person to sit and act like the controller
  * But nothing happens - the planes don't come
  * Cargo cult science: investigation that follows all the forms and precepts of science... except that its results don't hold up in the real world ("the planes don't land")
* So what is cargo-cult science missing?
  * Scientific integrity
    * You must report on everything that might cast doubt on your experiment
    * Other hypotheses that explain the results should be reported as well
  * Contrast with advertising - which seeks to tell only part of the truth in order to portray its product in the best possible light
  * Eventually the truth will out - eventually people will try to reproduce your experiment and they won't be able to reproduce your results
* So why is science hard
  * People find it easy to deceive themselves
  * Example with Millikan's oil drop experiment
    * When scientists got a number that was too far away from Millikan's original value, they suspected they'd done something wrong and threw out the value
    * When they got a number that was closer, they didn't check so hard
* How to avoid cargo cult science:
  * Don't fool yourself -- you are the easiest person to fool
  * When you've succeeded at not fooling yourself, communicate your findings in an honest way to everyone else
  * Bonus: don't fool laymen when you're speaking as a scientist - if there aren't real applications to your work, be honest about that
  * How do you avoid fooling yourself?
    * Preregister your ideas - publish no matter which way the experiment comes out
    * Don't take others' findings for granted - before you try to build upon an idea, do what you can to reproduce it so that you know you're building atop a solid foundation
      * Yes, people will say that reproducing already discovered results is a waste of time - those people are dumb
    * Pay attention to meta-science - people aren't just discovering facts about the phenomenon you're studying, they're also discovering facts about the experimental apparatus needed to get valid results
      * Example: study with rats running down corridor - no new findings about rat behavior, but many new discoveries about experiment design
    * Worry about the process more than the result - if you have a process that yields reproducible results, stick with it, no matter how tempting it may feel to deviate

## [Sam Harris: The Pleasures of Drowning](https://www.samharris.org/blog/item/the-pleasures-of-drowning)
* Martial arts have become divorced from the real world of knowing how to defend yourself
* Students spend time going through drills without stopping to consider if those drills have any correspondence to real world attack scenarios
* Many effective techniques are too dangerous to practice effectively, so they're neglected, and also acquire a reputation for being fight-enders when they're really not
* How do brazilian jiu-jitsu and other grappling arts remedy this?
  * Can be safely practiced under conditions of "100% resistance"
* Brazilian jiu-jitsu makes you want to learn, by making your ignorance painfully manifest
* UFC brings science back to martial arts - martial artists are fighting "for real" against other martial artists, and the best method of fighting is the one that wins fights
* In the absence of rules prohibiting clinching, fighters tend to grab a hold of one another and grapple
* This clinch tends to persist, and the bigger fighter or more experienced wrestler takes the other person to the ground
* Once a fight goes to the ground, Brazilian jiu-jitsu has the advantage
* So what is the best method of fighting? All of the above, depending on distance:
  * At arms length: punching like a western boxer and kicking like a Thai boxer
  * Closer in: Thai boxing - striking with knees and elbows
  * Once your opponent grabs you - freestyle wrestling - controlling posture and throwing your opponent to the ground
  * On the ground - Brazilian jiu-jitsu
* The problem with learning Brazilian jiu-jitjsu exclusively is that it biases you to go to the ground, when in a real street-fight going to the ground is the last thing you want to do
* But if you find yourself on the ground, grappling with someone, Brazilian jiu-jitsu is the surest way of making sure you win

## [Nate Soares: Failing with Abandon](http://mindingourway.com/failing-with-abandon/)
* You can limit failure
* It doesn't follow that you can drop your self control entirely just because you've missed a goal by a little bit
* You can stop yourself after going "one over"
* Remember, you put your targets there - if you missed by a little bit, remember that it's *your* target, not imposed by an external authority

## [Nate Soares: Rest in Motion](http://mindingourway.com/rest-in-motion/)
* The work that needs to be done is not a finite list of tasks, it is a neverending stream
* The goal is to move through the work, to do things
* Inaction is boring - the ground state for most people is an active one, not a passive one
* The actual reward state for most people isn't one where you're doing nothing, it's one where you're doing the things that you *want* to do, rather than things you *have* to do
* Rest when you need to rest, not when you've run out of work to do (hint: you'll never run out of work to do)
* Instead of thinking of your work in terms of lists (which are finite), think about your work in terms of streams (which are not)
* Divide your work up into streams (rest is a stream too) and consume tasks from each stream at the rate that you can do them
* Do what needs doing at a sustainable pace

## [George Orwell: Politics and the English Language](http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit)
* Language is a tool, and, as such, we can choose to alter it
* Slovenly language makes it easier to have foolish thoughts
* So, how do we avoid slovenly language?
  * Avoid staleness of imagery
  * Be *precise* in what you're saying
  * The worst kind of writing is where the writer means one thing and says something else, or writes some prose indifferent to whether it means anything at all
* Specific things to avoid
  * Dying metaphors: 
    * There are original metaphors, which evoke a visual image and assist thought
    * There are "dead" metaphors, which have passed on to being ordinary words or phrases
    * The danger is in using metaphors that are overused, but not so overused as to be considered an ordinary word
    * The "dying metaphors" have lost the ability to evoke, but don't really have a fixed meaning as an ordinary word
    * Don't mix incompatible metaphors
  * Operators or false verbal limbs
    * Don't eliminate simple verbs to make your sentence look more fancy
    * Instead of being a single word, the verb becomes a phrase
    * Most people who militate against the "passive voice" are actually warning against this
  * Pretentious diction
    * Fancy words used for the sake of having fancy words
    * Latin phrases used in contexts where Latin phrases make no sense (e.g. outside of law, medicine, and history)
    * Instead of using fancy words, come up with some actual *English* that describes what you're trying to say
  * Meaningless words
    * If a sentence doesn't contribute to the conclusion, *cut it out*
    * Be concrete!
* The real crime in modern writing is that writers no longer think of true things, and then choose words to describe those things to others
* Instead they assemble strips of words created by others and then let the meanings of those words drive what is true
* The cost of this is that meaning is muddled both for the author and the reader - how is the reader to know what the author means when it's not even clear to the author what he or she means?
* A good writer will ask him or herself the following 4 questions:
  * What am I trying to say?
  * What words will express it?
  * Is there any imagery that will make my meaning clearer?
  * Is the image fresh enough to have an effect?
  * Bonus questions:
    * Can I make it shorter?
    * Is my writing ugly?
* Political and bureaucratic writing is often ugly, stale, meaningless writing
* The advantage of this style of writing is that they make horrors seem banal, and allow us to defend that which is hard to defend while keeping alleigiance with middle-class virtues
  * Things like dropping the atomic bomb or continued British rule in India may be defended, but only by using arguments that are too difficult for most people to bear
  * The advantage of this kind of soggy writing is that it allows us to name things without making them visible
* Language is fixable
  * If enough of us set our minds to using clear language, then clear language will win
* Final guidelines:
  * Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech that you are used to seeing in print
  * Never use a long word when a short word will do
  * If it is possible to cut a word out, cut it out
  * Never use the passive when you can use the active
  * Never use a foreign phrase, scientific word, or jargon if there is an English equivalent that will serve
  * Break any of the above rules to make your writing more beautiful
* The goal is to make stupidity obvious, both to the writer as well as to the reader
* [Editor's note: whenever I see 'concomitant' in print, I think of [this comic](http://www.schlockmercenary.com/2006-03-12)]
