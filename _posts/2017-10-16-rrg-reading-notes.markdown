## [The Crash of Flight 90: Doomed By Self-Deception](http://www.roberttrivers.com/Robert_Trivers/Publications_files/T%26Newton1982article-2.pdf)
* Air Florida Flight 90 crashed into a bridge on takeoff from Washington National Airport, killing 78
* Pilots failed to turn on engine anti-icing systems, causing loss of thrust
* Co-pilot pointed out discrepancy in instruments, but pilot proceeded with takeoff anyway
* The accident was the result of a pattern of self-deception by the pilot and insufficient forcefulness on the part of the co-pilot to correct that self-deception
* Pilot consistently chooses to minimize problems, while co-pilot is accurately pointing out the extent of ice on the plane
* Pilot's excessive confidence fools co-pilot into thinking that everything is going to be all right

## [Competent Elites](http://lesswrong.com/lw/ub/competent_elites/)
* Elites are elite for a reason
* It's possible that people who are richer than you are just *better*, in every way
  * More happy
  * More intelligent
  * Etc.
* If this is true, then it is in no one's interest to acknowledge it
* It's not the in the interest of those in the power elite to talk to those outside the power elite

## [Humans Are Born Irrational And That Has Made Us Better Decision Makers](https://qz.com/922924/humans-werent-designed-to-be-rational-and-we-are-better-thinkers-for-it/)
* Rationality only makes sense in the context of a goal
* We don't have the time or capability to calculate probabilities for every decision
* Even data-based predictions don't inoculate against irrationality or prejudice
  * In the financial crisis, experts were convinced that it was far more unlikely than it actually was for house prices to go down in a correlated fashion
  * It's possible to convince yourself that you're being rational, when in reality you're overfitting to historical data
* Rationality ignore the fact that decisions rest as much on subjective preferences as they do on objective facts
* People tend to rely on heuristics rather than statistics and this is a good thing
  * Recognition heuristic is better at predicting winners of Wimbledon than ATP rankings
  * Hyperbolic discounting is a good proxy for modeling uncertainties that may prevent us from getting a payout in the future
* Emotions are key to decision-making
  * People who have brain damage that leaves them unable to feel emotion have trouble making decisions
  * Emotions are how you know what your preferences are
  * Courage can be seen as excessive optimism, but it leads to great results for society
* Decisions are made in a social context
  * The social implications of a decision affect us as much as the consequences of the decision itself
  * Our ability to agree with those around us is key to our ability to cooperate

## [Why I Am Not A Quaker (even though it often seems as though I should be)](http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/why-i-am-not-a-quaker-even-though-it-often-seems-as-though-i-should-be/)
* The Society of Friends (a.k.a Quakers) have come to the right conclusions in a wide variety of domains
* Their virtues are those of liberalism, as are their vices
* Why we should respect the Society of Friends
  * Proto-liberal beliefs
    * Freedom of conscience
    * Belief in individual liberty
    * Belief in individuals' moral choices
  * Personal integrity as a radical practice
    * Refuse to sign letters with "normal" pleasantries, because they were considered insincere
    * Preferred virtue over profit in business negotiations
  * Nonviolent social technology
    * Reliance on persuasion over force
    * Extremely collaborative decision-making
    * Treat dissent as signal to be processed rather than noise to be suppressed
  * Humble marketing - focus on providing high quality goods and services, and trust that customers will find a way to you
* So why isn't Ben a Quaker?
  * Quakerism is vulnerable to arbitrage
    * If you allocate your resources toward good works, then others can profit from opposing you
    * If you volunteer to help after a disaster, you create an incentive against preventing the disaster in the first place
    * Vulnerable to specious guarantees - Starbucks can't deceive you about the quality of their coffee, but they can deceive you about their fair-trade practices
  * Quakerism works well in a closed system or an isolated intentional community, but it works less well when there are other groups that will intentionally exploit its weaknesses
  * Quakers don't pay enough attention to the problem of child-rearing - means that community will die out over a span of generations
  * The problem that many intentional communities have is that their values conflict with the outside world, forcing people to choose either economic success or community membership
* Alternatives to Quaker values
  * Puritans
    * Don't exist any more
    * Don't seem very fun
    * Very traditionalist - probably wouldn't be open to some of rationality's more radical conclusions
  * Jews
    * Jews are drifting away from Orthodox Judaism as they're forced to make compromises to remain relevant in a modern economy
    * Haredi Jews are much more insular, but they're alos much more dogmatic and don't seem to be make much material progress
  * Academic communities - focus on the integrity of their intellectual production, but are dependent on outside world for new members 
  * Hippie communities - seem to live well, but don't seem to produce much in the way of material progress
  * Burning man
    * Only lasts two weeks
    * No artifacts of lasting value
