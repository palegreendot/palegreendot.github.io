## [On Punitive Restoration](https://quarterly.demos.co.uk/article/issue-2/on-punitive-restoration/)
* There is a tension within the criminal justice system between reducing re-offense rates and instilling public confidence
* Improvements to one can come at the expense of the other
    * Increasing severity of punishments can make reducing crime more difficult
    * Example: California's 3-strikes law
        * Negligible deterrent effect
        * Huge increase in prison population
* Our current model isn't working
    * Current sentencing practices only apply to a handful of people, since most cases end in a plea bargain
    * This is unfair to victims, the offender, and to the public
        * Victims can't publicly affirm their stories
        * Offender and public lose out because the court loses the ability to decide sentences - can only affirm or veto the punishment in the plea deal
    * Greater use of restorative justice can lead to a model of criminal justice that avoids the problems outlined above
* Restorative Justice: A First Step
    * Two particular forms
        * Victim-offender mediation
        * Restorative conferencing
    * Goal is to "restore" the offender back to being a lawful citizen
    * Meetings held by a trained facilitator and only when the offender admits guilt
    * Provide an opportunity for constructive dialog
    * Participation must be voluntary
    * Meeting structure
        * Facilitator clarifies parameters and purpose of meeting
        * Victim has an opportunity to speak, address the offender and state how their crime impacted them
        * Offender speaks last, and accounts for their crime
        * Meeting ends with the participants confirming a restorative contract
    * Restorative justice is more effective than traditional punishment
        * Participants in restorative meetings confirm higher satisfaction in the process than in alternatives
        * Re-offense rates under restorative justice programs are up to 25% lower than re-offense rates in traditional sentencing
* The need for a new model
    * Restorative justice is currently being held back from wider application because it doesn't include the possibility of prison as part of a restorative contract
    * If prison can be recast as a way of providing more intensive interventions when other options are not feasible, prison can be made compatible with the tenets of restorative justice
    * This hybrid model can be termed "punitive restoration"
    * Expanding restorative justice to include some punitive options can lead to less punitive system overall
    * Can allow for more widespread use of restorative justice without undermining public confidence in the system

## [Anger and Trauma](https://www.ptsd.va.gov/public/problems/anger-and-trauma.asp)
* Why is anger a common response to trauma
    * Anger is a core part of the survival response in human beings
    * Help people cope with stress by shifting focus toward the problem that has to be solved
    * However this anger can create problems after the trauma has ended
* How can anger after trauma become a problem
    * Person's response to extreme threat can become "stuck" and become their response to all challenges
    * Three key aspects of post-traumatic anger
        * Arousal - muscle tension, irritability, feeling of being "on edge"
        * Behavior - impulsiveness, only using aggressive responses
        * Thoughts and beliefs - belief that threat is all around, even when this is not true
* How can someone get help with anger
    * CBT is a commonly used technique that helps with all three aspects
    * Arousal - learn skills, such as relaxation techniques, that lower the overall level of arousal
    * Behavior - expand on range of possible responses when confronted with stress
    * Thoughts/beliefs - come up with more positive thoughts to replace anger

## [Review: Sarah Schulman's Conflict Is Not Abuse presents a shift in thinking about power relations, harm and social responsibility](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/books-and-media/book-reviews/review-sarah-schulmans-conflict-is-not-abuse-presents-a-shift-in-thinking-about-power-relations-harm-and-social-responsibility/article32813565/)
* Premise of book: we are conflating conflict with abuse
    * Conflict is "power struggle" and is a normal part of existence for individuals, groups and states
    * Abuse is "power over" and is characterized by lopsided domination of one side by another
* Terms come from the social work community and are used at the interpersonal level, but can also be used to provide moral clarity when looking at group and state conflict
* According to Schulman, we live in an era of "overreaction to conflict and underreaction to abuse"
* Need to distinguish overstatement of harm from the harm itself
* The danger of mischaracterizing conflict as abuse is that it lowers the bar for what we term abuse, allowing abusers to claim the position of victim
