## [The Categories Were Made For Man, Not Man For The Categories](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/21/the-categories-were-made-for-man-not-man-for-the-categories/)

Previously discussed on [April 30, 2018](https://palegreendot.net/rrg_notes/2018/04/30/rrg-reading-notes.html#the-categories-were-made-for-man-not-man-for-the-categories)

* Even if ancient Hebrews had perfect knowledge of animal genetics and phylogenics, they still wouldn't be wrong to call a whale a fish
* The distinction that mattered to Hebrews was not a matter of evolutionary ancestry, but rather, "Do I need a boat or a horse to catch it?"
* Definitions are only "correct" or "incorrect" insofar as they help us achieve some other goal
* In this definitions are much like the borders between countries - there is no such thing as a "correct" border; every border is the result of a particular set of political tradeoffs
* There is nothing in the world that dictates which characteristics you should use to define your categories - the only thing that matters is whether dividing the world by those categories is useful towards the goal that you wish to achieve
* This applies equally to questions of gender or mental illness
  * There is nothing forcing us to use particular physical or chromosomal characteristics to distinguish between male or female
  * There is nothing forcing us to use particular behavioral charactistics to distinguish between normal behavior and mental illness
* We should draw boundaries such that they're useful for the goals that we're trying to accomplish
* If these boundaries are no longer useful for our goals, we should (re)draw them differently so that they become useful

## [The Parable of the Dagger](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/hQxYBfu2LPc9Ydo6w/the-parable-of-the-dagger)

* Allegorical story
  * Jester plays a trick on a king, involving a riddle with two boxes
  * The king has the jester dragged away in chains
  * Later, the king offers the jester a similar problem
    * One box contains the key to the jester's freedom
    * The other box contains a dagger for the jester's heart
  * Jester solves the puzzle correctly, but finds the dagger anyway
  * When he asks how this is possible, the king says, in essence, "I lied."
* The lesson here is that logical reasoning isn't the same as finding information about the world
* Need to verify premises, in addition to reasoning correctly

## [The Parable of Hemlock](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/bcM5ft8jvsffsZZ4Y/the-parable-of-hemlock)

* The problem with making things true "by definition" is that you can't change reality by changing definitions
* Example:
  * All humans are mortal
  * Socrates is a human
  * Therefore Socrates is mortal
* This is perfectly valid logical reasoning
* However, it doesn't tell you anything new about the world
* Still need to find evidence that all humans are mortal and that Socrates is human
* Logical syllogisms are *valid*, but *valid* isn't the same thing as *true*
* Logic tells you only which outcomes are possible given a set of premises
  * Doesn't tell you whether your premises are correct
  * Doesn't tell you which of the possible outcomes will happen
