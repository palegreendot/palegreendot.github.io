## [All in All, Another Brick in the Motte](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/03/all-in-all-another-brick-in-the-motte/)
* The original use of *motte-and-bailey* was in critique of postmodernism
* Postmodernists claim that our perception of reality is influenced by the categories and prejudices of our society
* They then follow this up by claiming that beliefs unsupported by scientific evidence should be given just as much credence as beliefs supported by scientific evidence
* We can compare this pair of statements to a motte-and-bailey castle
  * Field of desirable and productive land - *bailey*
  * Tower in the middle - *motte*
  * People normally inhabit the bailey
  * When threatened, they retreat to the motte
* Motte-and-bailey is a perfect mirror-image of the [weak man](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/12/weak-men-are-superweapons/) fallacy
  * Weak-man is taking a weak or extreme non-representative position and pretending it's representative for the purpose of arguing against
  * Motte-and-bailey is taking a strong, but not-representative position and pretending that it's representative for the purpose of arguing for
* Both motte-and-bailey and weak-man result from people's tendencies to debate vague clouds of beliefs rather than specific propositions
* To get around both fallacies, taboo vague words and replace symbols with substance
* Have an actual thing you're trying to debate

## [On Exposing Hypocrisy](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2015/01/on-exposing-hypocrisy.html)
* Hypocrisy is when the stated justification for an action is belief X but the actual justification is belief Y
* What are some possible responses to suspected hypocrisy
  * Do nothing
  * Ask the person privately about your suspicions while publicly supporting their efforts
  * Confront the person privately and act mildly offended
  * Confront the person publicly and act deeply offended
  * Ask a mutual friend to ask the other person about their suspected hypocrisy
* If you like the person who's behaving hypocritically, and want them to be less of a hypocrite, what's the best approach?
* The safest approach is to do nothing
* We don't know whether people are more likely to update their actions to match their beliefs or update their beliefs to match their actions
* The problem with Effective Altruism is that it exposes people's hypocrisy around charity - don't know if the effect would be to make them give less or make them give more
* We should be careful about exposing hypocrisy until we better understand the effects of doing so

## [Be Comfortable With Hypocrisy](http://lesswrong.com/lw/k12/be_comfortable_with_hypocrisy/)
* Why do we place so much stock in self-consistency?
* Placing too much of an emphasis on self-consistency can cause us to shy away from important issues, because we feel that we would be hypocritical to do so
* Example: meat eater talking about animal rights
* We can either back down from high moral ideals or be more comfortable with hypocrisy

## [Ditch The Word 'Hypocrite'](https://nothingismere.com/2015/09/16/ditch-the-word-hypocrite/)
* Calling someone out for hypocrisy is too meta
  * Completely ignores the truth value of their actual argument
  * Hypocrisy is a claim that you can make regardless of the actual facts
  * If someone is being hypocritical, then either what they're saying is false, or what they're doing is false, so just attack the falsehood
* Charges of hypocrisy discourage updating and nuance
  * The best way to avoid hypocrisy is to say nothing substantive at all
  * Knowing that they can be called out for hypocrisy prevents people from changing or updating their views
* Calling a group out for hypocrisy reduces the intellectual diversity of the group
  * Every group has a range of opinions
  * If two members of a group diverge sufficiently in their opinions, the entire group can be called out for hypocrisy
  * Therefore, people will avoid associating with those who hold less defensible positions, to protect their group
* Ambitious goal-setting and self-improvement can look like behavioral hypocrisy
  * Accusing people of hypocrisy encourages them to hold themselves to low, but achievable standards
  * It's hard to talk about the values you want your community to have without looking a little bit hypocritical
