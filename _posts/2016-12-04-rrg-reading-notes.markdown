## Reading Notes

### [The Gervais Principle V: Heads I Win, Tails You Lose](http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2011/10/14/the-gervais-principle-v-heads-i-win-tails-you-lose/)
* Hamartia - fatal error born of unavoidable ignorance
  * Concept from ancient Greece
  * Inevitably leads to destruction when combined with moral flaws
  * Humans are not only cursed by mortality of the flesh, but by hamartia-driven spiritual weakness
* Nietzsche 
  * God is dead - only the flesh is real
  * The only rule governing the universe is the constant grind of entropy
  * Entropy offers everyone a choice: death or reproduction
    * Clueless - choose death boldly
    * Losers - choose reproduction carefully
    * Sociopaths - try to find a way out of the choice
* Heads I Win, Tails You Lose
  * Abbreviated as HIWTYL ("hightail")
  * Tendency to grab more than your fair share of the rewards, and less than your fair share of the blame
  * Sociopaths are not interested in individual HIWTYL scenarios - they engineer systems and processes that reliably, predictably and stealthily generate HIWTYL situations
  * Systematically claim paternity for successess and orphan failures
* The Golden Ticket Reconsidered
  * Golden ticket scenario
    * Idea that initially seems good
    * Seemed to go bad
    * Worked out good in the end
  * How would you try to maximize gains and limit your losses with such an idea?
    * Asymmetric incentives - bonuses for success, no penalties for failure
    * Use committees to distribute responsibility
      * Make sure that the head of the committee is a Clueless
    * Launder your ideas through committees created above
    * If the scheme succeeds, you claim success, distribute a small portion of the reward to the committee and walk away with the lion's share
    * If the scheme fails, you split the blame three ways:
      * Nominally accountable Clueless chairperson - incompetence
      * Losers on committee - poor esprit de corps - accuse them of not being motivated/engaged enough
      * Processes used by committee itself
    * The processes used to shift blame should also try to reduce the total magnitude of the blame, by making major forseeable screw-ups look like minor unexpected mishaps
  * Three questions:
    * How do you generate HIWTYL situations over large scales and long time-horizons?
    * What happens to the portion of the blame not assigned to anyone?
    * Why shouldn't we account for blame fairly?
* The Hanlon Dodge
  * Hanlon's razor: never ascribe to malice what can be adequately explained by stupidity
  * Use the stupidity of Clueless to mask the malice of the Sociopaths
  * Combine misapplication of Hanlon's razor with the human tendency to link penalties intent rather than consequences
  * Shift the locus of blame from malice to incompetence to lower penalties
  * Sociopaths use Hanlon's razor to feign incompetence themselves, or accuse others of incompetence, as necessary
  * Feigning incompetence - ends are justifiable, but means are not
    * Feign your own incompetence to get someone else to come in and do the work for your
    * Can be used to dodge menial work
  * Accusing others of incompetence - means are justifiable, ends are not
    * Engineer execution failures via indirection and abstraction
    * Acheive ends via "lucky accidents"
    * Example: ask employees to do "their utmost" to accomplish a goal
      * Allows Sociopath to keep their hands clean while ensuring that illegal means still get used
  * Seasoned Sociopaths maintain a permanent facade of strategic incompetence and ignorance, rather than just making up situational incompetence
  * Combine this with indirection and abstration in things asked of reports to create HIWTYL scenarios
  * What is the difference between a HIWTYL scenario and a scenario in which a report is given genuine autonomy?
    * If you want to genuinely give people autonomy and room to grow, you allow them autonomy in areas they're strong
    * When you want engineered failures, you give them autonomy in areas they're weak
  * Hanlon's Razor allows Sociopaths to avoid doing unpleasant things themselves, achieve indefensible goals, and maintain plausible deniability the whole time
  * Theater of justification
    * Only Clueless and Losers debate whether the ends justify the means
    * Sociopaths know that there are only ends and justifications
* Divide and Conquer
  * Losers, as individuals, are too smart to fall for Hanlon Dodges
  * Need to exploit groupthink
  * 2 key features of Loser groups to exploit:
    * Many active fault lines
      * These fault lines are necessary to ensure status illegibility
      * But can be exploited by Sociopaths to turn group members against one another without having to manufacture reasons
      * If enough schisms aren't there to be exploited, offer incentives to one subgroup and they'll naturally work to screw over the others
    * Naturally apportion credit and blame in ways that don't balance
      * Losers will only accept blame in inverse proportion to self-perceived status
      * If everybody (or, at least everybody who is not the Omega) believes themselves above average, everyone will try to assign more of the blame to others and less to themselves
      * Opposite process with success - the higher your self-perceived status, the greater the share of success you try to claim
      * Internal valuations of earned credit are inflated
      * Internal valuations of blame run a deficit
      * Leads to a group overvaluing its strengths and underestimating its weaknesses
      * Sociopaths use divide-and-conquer tactics to create "valuation events" that force a thorough accounting of credit and blame along some axis
      * This causes (illusory) social capital to be destroyed, fissuring the group into to illegible subgroups
  * Loser psychology
    * Losers have a genuine sense of honor
    * Want to apportion credit and blame fairly
    * HIWTYL instincts are buried under a layer of denial
    * Have empathy and natural solidarity - won't pull naked HIWTYL maneuvers
    * Losers need to dehumanize their victims (or have them dehumanized by Sociopaths) before they'll pull HIWTYL plays
* The Gilded Cage
  * Blame apportioned to formal and institutionalized relationships within a community
  * Paperwork (e.g. forms)
  * The purpose of paperwork is not to serve the person who submits it, but to protect the person who processes it
  * The purpose of paperwork isn't to do what it explicitly says, it's to allow the organization to pretend that it did what the paperwork says
    * Calvin and Hobbes: "Let's not and say we did"
  * Reports must not exhibit any autonomy when executing paperwork
  * Autonomy implies responsibility, and the entire point of paperwork is to dodge responsibility
* Bureaucracy
  * Assumes knowledge of [staff vs. line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staff_and_line) distinction
    * Line: workers that directly advances the core priorities of the organization
      * People who do the things that the organization ostensibly does
      * Think assembly _line_ workers
    * Staff: supports the organization with advisory and support functions
      * People who (ostensibly) help the line workers do their jobs
      * Think _support staff_
    * HR, accounting, legal, etc are all staff positions
    * Line positions tend to be much more organization dependent
      * Manufacturing
      * Engineering
      * R & D
  * 2 parts of risk management
    * Unpredictable part - handled by line hierarchy
    * Predictable part - handled by staff hierarchy
  * Predictable risk management allows Sociopaths to engineer the organization to generate HIWTYL situations for them
  * This is the true role of bureaucracy
    * Do things that are in the interest of Sociopaths efficiently and competently
    * Do things that the organization is expected to do, but would cut in to the profits of Sociopaths poorly or not at all
    * Obstruct, delay and kill things that might hurt the interests of Sociopaths
  * Sociopaths design systems to extract the easy value from whatever market opportunity motivates the creation of the firm
    * Don't bother making expensive investments that won't pay off before the organization hits diminishing returns
  * Bureaucracy is inherently Clueless by design
  * Designed to fail in ways that achieve unspoken Sociopath intentions, while allowing them to claim nobler explicit intentions
  * Members of hierarchy have to play along - bureaucracy is incompatible with autonomy
  * So what happens when the bureaucratic rules dictate clearly inappropriate responses to situations?
    * On paper - appeal decisions or trigger exceptions
      * Only works when decision would benefit Sociopaths
      * Increasingly complicated exception clauses are added to rules to make the process of appeal even slower and more costly for non-Sociopath aligned cases
      * Has the side-benefit of making rules totally incomprehensible - confuses bureaucrats into docility
    * So how do you get the bureaucracy to do something it wasn't designed to?
      * Stealth
      * Support from high-up Sociopath
      * Corruption and bribery
  * So how does a Clueless-by-design bureaucracy shift blame?
    * Transfer responsibility onto the "system"
    * Can't blame members for malice, only for being "cogs" or "tools"
  * However, bureaucracy is fundamentally a staff system, rather than a line system, and its Sociopaths merely seek rents rather than active returns
* The Burden of Organizational Sins
  * Blame is apportioned by Socipaths among the above three groups:
    * Individual Clueless (via Hanlon Dodges)
    * Loser Culture (via divide-and-conquer)
    * Bureaucracy (by design)
  * Sociopaths are highly complicit, but able to deny almost all of the complicity
  * Losers are trapped via divide-and-conquer maneuvers and cannot completely deny their complicity, except to themselves
  * Clueless are least complicit in terms of actual intentions, are put in systems that protect them via their own cluelessness
  * While some accumulate more blame than others, the system overall is designed to be non-zero-sum
  * So what happens to the blame that doesn't get allocated to anyone?
  * Organizational dark matter
    * Decreasing morale
    * Reinforcement of incompetence
    * Organization itself turns into a byzantine, incomprehensible maze as it pretends to self-correct
    * Systems and processes are clogged with delayed exceptions
  * The organization itself accepts the unaccounted for blame and slowly begins to die for the sins of the people within it

### [The Gervais Principle Part VI: Children of an Absent God](http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2013/05/16/the-gervais-principle-vi-children-of-an-absent-god/)
* Power from Emptiness
  * David Wallace's vacuum cleaner is a metaphor for Sociopath lives
  * Generate power from emptiness; allows Sociopaths to turn themselves into forces of nature
  * When Sociopath stories end, the Clueless and Loser stories that continue become bereft of meaning - cargo cult organizations
* The Quest for Unmediated Realities
  * Sociopath journey begins with a religious dissatisfaction
  * Find that contemporary narratives are too convenient for those with power - prevailing social order is necessary and natural
  * Sociopaths start their journeys to rid themselves of the feeling that reality is more complex than what is being presented to them
    * Suspcious that things hidden are not being hidden for their own good
  * Want to engage reality directly, with no mediation from other humans
  * Stylized for Clueless the Sociopath's struggle becomes the Hero's Journey
  * Stylized for Losers, the Sociopath's struggle becomes religion - absolution for sins and a sign of grace
  * To Sociopaths themselves, the journey is a nihilistic journey into emptiness
* Finding Amorality
  * Sociopaths don't fear amorality, they aspire to it
  * Sociopath's journey is the progressive unmasking of harsher and harsher social orders
  * Morality goes first
  * Then the idea of a benevolent universe
  * Then the idea of predictable relationships between effort and rewards
  * As they keep ripping away layers, Sociopaths find transient meaning but not enduring satisfaction
  * However, surprisingly, they find power over others
  * Sociopaths acquire agency by searching for meaning
  * This allows them to mediate reality for others
* Gods Who Talk Back
  * Small minds discuss people, average minds discuss events. Great minds discuss ideas. - Elanor Roosevelt (attributed)
  * The distinction between theism and atheism is for small and average minds
  * Sociopaths understand that the true distinction is between gods that talk back and gods that don't
  * Sociopaths inhabit the Darwinist/Protestant ethic
    * Darwinist is atheistic
    * Protestant is religious
    * But both have the common attribute of a silent god
  * The religions of Clueless and Losers are ultimately religions of happiness
    * Seek a socially mediated relationships with reality - the very thing the Sociopath seeks to escape
    * Gods are always talking back somehow
  * The gods of the sociopath are absent meanings and voices
    * Sociopaths are truly alone in a way that Clueless and Losers aren't
    * Sociopath religion is a recipe for neurotic self-destruction, with a chance at true freedom
  * When Sociopaths accept the divine roles that Clueless and Losers entrust them with, they rule the realities of others
    * However, any human stand-in for the divine is going to be a let-down
    * The believers are always betrayed
    * Get the Clueless to blame themselves
    * Get the Losers to blame each other
    * Each gives a particular form or religiosity
* The Rankable Hero-God
  * In solitude, Clueless minds turn to contemplation of their idols
  * Idealized organizations and unreconstructed idols
  * Gods are far-removed but attainable heroes
  * Heroes are distant, but a countable number of steps away
  * Heroes can themselves be ranked 
  * Clueless heroes are to be imitated and life in Clueless heaven is not dissimilar from life on Clueless earth
  * Everything in Clueless religion is countable
    * Sins are countable as demerits
    * Rewards are concrete
  * Sociopaths can serve as high-ranking hero-gods so long as the conceal the "elevator" they took to get to a high level
    * Hide social advantages
    * Hide "privilege"
    * Hide out-and-out cheating
    * Even failures don't demote one from god-hood - only alters ranks within the pantheon
  * Innocent, child-like religiosity
  * When Clueless are betrayed by Sociopaths, they usually react with misguided honor and loyalty
    * Ocassionally try ineffectual revenge
    * Reaction to betrayal is a loss of innocence
    * Very rarely, this turns the Clueless into a Sociopath directly
      * Clueless see the non-legible side of the social order and seek to manipulate it
      * This turns them into a Sociopath
    * Usually what happens is that the Clueless turns into a Loser - loses faith in the organization, becomes a checked-out minimum effort producer
* Wrangling Loser Spirituality
  * Loser spirituality revolves around social events and the associated changes in status and emotions
  * Losers see themselves as spiritual, but not religious
  * Yearning to be "indivisibly" part of something larger than themselves
  * Belongingness/oneness-with-the-divine
  * No explicit concrete rewards or demerits
  * Balance illegible emotional experiences against one another
  * Overweight social behaviors over material substance
    * Would rather have $10 presented with respect than $100 presented spitefully
* The Sociopath as Priest
  * Because Losers don't look to closely at the material results, they're able to be manipulated by Sociopaths who do
  * Explicitly tying non-material rewards to material rewards generates emotional drama, which Sociopaths use to divide and conquer Loser groups
  * Sociopaths frame their contribution to betrayal situations between Loser groups as necessary and inevitable
  * In the theater of Loser spirituality, Sociopaths add inevitable-seeming events and emotional boundary conditions
  * Because the Sociopaths stand apart from Loser group consciousness, they're able to dispense absolution for guilt - the one emotion that Losers cannot resolve for themselves
  * Unlike Clueless, Losers are often betrayed in groups
    * Losers turn into Sociopaths by catching a glimpse of unmediated reality during a Sociopath divide-and-conquer play and correctly assign blame to the Sociopath
* Meaning and Power Through Withdrawal
  * The process of creative destruction in the Sociopath mind creates power, but destroys meaning
  * It is this process that allows them to gain power over others
  * Sociopaths create meaning through the things they subtract, rather than the things they add
  * Subtractive simplification is much easier than creating fake realities and yields just as much power
  * Sociopaths subtract human fraility and fallibility to create heroes for the Clueless
  * Subtract participatory emotion to turn themselves into detached priests for the Losers
  * In each case, the Sociopath withdraws information: personalities and inner lives for the Clueless, and information about specific situations and material realities for the Losers
  * Clueless cannot process anything that isn't finite, external and countable - gives Sociopath power by allowing them to handle illegible, uncountable subtleties
  * Losers cannot process the material aspect of anything that involves strong emotional content - gives Sociopath power by allowing the material advantage in exchange for emotional absolution
  * Sociopaths do not _take_ power; power is _given_ to them by Losers and Clueless who rely on Sociopaths to process parts of reality that they cannot process for themselves
* Power Literacy
  * The Sociopath's process of carving out finite and tractable realities for Clueless and Losers creates layers of social realities that gamify the world
  * Sociopathy is about recognizing that there are no social realities
  * Only masks
  * Social realities are a hierarchy of convenient fictions for those predisposed to believe that humanity is special in some way
  * Any ideas that put humans into a special position (like justice, fairness, ethics, etc.) are raw material for mediated abstractions that can be used to control Clueless and Losers
  * As Sociopaths tear away the abstractions that govern social reality, the process becomes instinctive - power literacy
* Reality Shock
  * As Sociopaths disassemble social abstractions, they automatically devalue those abstractions
  * The culmination of this process reveals to the Sociopath that there is no god at all - that reality is fundamentally meaningless
  * No special place for humans
  * Visceral, rather than intellectual moment
  * Sociopaths don't need a non-existent God; one that's merely disinterested in our universe will do
  * To weather reality shock is to get over one's terror at an absent god, and awaken to the freedom that condition represents
* Free as in Speech, Free as in Lunch
  * Free as in speech - Sociopath has creative freedom in scripting social realities for others
    * Manipulate "cherished human values"
  * Free as in lunch - Sociopath has nearly zero accountability, thanks to agency ceded to him by Losers and Clueless
    * "Moral hazard"
    * "Principal-agent problem"
  * Losers and Clueless vaguely sense that the realities being presented by Sociopaths are bullshit - not so much a lie as completely orthogonal to the truth
  * Sociopaths have figured out that amorality is the norm in the universe - that morality is carved out by Sociopaths for the benefit of Losers and Clueless
  * In this way, the lives of Sociopaths are incomprehensible to non-Sociopaths
    * Clueless and Losers have to invent hidden social realities that govern the actions of Sociopaths
* The Birth of the Messiah
  * Most Sociopaths that weather reality-shock accept their permanent estrangement from non-Sociopaths
  * Some Sociopaths regret their knowledge of the ultimate reality of the universe - ultimate freedom also implies ultimate responsibility
  * These Sociopaths reject their freedom and attempt to rejoin humanity
    * This effort is doomed to failure
    * What is known cannot be un-known
  * These Sociopaths become Messiahs 
    * Protect innocence of Clueless
    * Restore the faith of Losers
    * Restore peoples' world-views after potential disillusionment and ascent (descent?) into Sociopathy
  * Try to participate in Loser behaviors, but the action is fundamentally empty for them
    * Messiahs are "social black holes"
* Certainty of Nothingness
  * So, what have we learned from all this?

### [Geeks, MOPs, and sociopaths in subculture evolution](https://meaningness.com/metablog/geeks-mops-sociopaths)
* Subcultures are dead
* Main creative cultural force from 1975 to 2000
* Why did they stop working?
  * As soon as subcultures start to get interesting, they get invaded by _muggles_, who ruin them
  * Around 2000 people stopped hoping that subcultures could escape this dynamic and gave up on them
* The Birth of Cool
  * Before there is a subculture, there is a _scene_
    * Small group of creators who invent an exciting new thing
      * Musical genre
      * Religious sect
      * Technological advancement
      * Political theory
    * The new scene draws fanatics
      * Fanatics don't create
      * Contribute time, money, organization, adulation to creators
    * Creators and fanatics are both _geeks_
    * Distinguishing characteristics of geeks:
      * Love the New Thing
      * Fascinated by esoteric ins and outs
      * Spend all their time either working on it or talking about it
    * If a scene is sufficiently geeky, it remains a geek thing - turns into a weird hobby rather than a subculture
    * If a scene is unusually exciting, and can be appreciated without having to get geeky about details, it draws _mops_.
      * Original term: MOP (member of public)
      * Alternatively: "casuals", "tourists", "posers"
    * Initially geeks welcome mops
    * Mops provide resources that geeks can use
      * Ego boosts
      * Enough financial support that the best geeks can quit their day jobs and go pro
      * These geeks produce more and better New Thing
* The mop invasion
  * Mops are welcome at first, but when they grow too numerous they dilute the culture
  * Mops don't really like the New Thing - it's too weird and complicated for them to process
  * They prefer the diluted version of the new thing, that's closer to what mainstream culture has led them to expect
  * Rather than talking about the New Thing nonstop, mops talk about normie pursuits, like sports and celebrities
  * At this point the fanatics may become disgusted and give up, leading to the collapse of the subculture
* The sociopath invasion
  * Creators generate cultural capital
  * Fanatics generate social capital
  * Mops, when properly exploited, produce _liquid_ capital (i.e. money)
  * None of these groups have any idea how to exploit this capital
  * Sociopaths come in and become best friends with selected creators
    * Dress like creators, but a bit better
    * Talk like creators, but a bit smoother
    * Even do some of the creative activity - sociopaths are competent, but not groundbreaking
    * Geeks aren't fooled - they're sufficiently in touch with the state-of-the-art to distinguish a sociopath from a true geek
    * However, geeks don't know why sociopaths are there
  * Mops _are_ fooled by sociopaths
    * Sociopaths are like geeks, but better
    * Quickly gain the adulation of mops that used to be going to geeks
    * Work out how to monetize the subculture
    * Funnel a tiny proportion of the money to creators
    * Enable more creators to go pro, but not so many that the creative product is devalued
    * Hire fanatics as service workers 
      * Fanatics resent it, but are also drawn in by the appeal of working full-time on the New Thing
* The Death of Cool -- Unless...
  * After a couple of years, the cultural, social and financial capital of the subculture is used up
  * New Thing is no longer so new as to merit attention
  * Sociopaths leave behind broken geeks - divide and conquer manipulation tactics cause fissures and divisions
  * However, if some of the creators are true geniuses, and they get correct support from sociopaths, they can ascend into "superstardom"
* Resistance
  * The subculture lifecycle is only problematic for geeks
  * Provides reliable, low-cost waves of novelty for mops
  * Provides easily exploited pools of prestige, sex, power and money for sociopaths
  * Exclusion
    * Create costly barriers for entry
    * Keeps out posers, but limits potential
    * There is usually a conflict between geeks who want the subculture to remain small and ideologically pure, and those who want it to grow and gain power
    * Keeping a 6:1 ratio of mops to geeks is about right
    * Anything higher than 10:1 risks burnout for the fanatics
    * Sociopaths only show up when there are mops to exploit, so limiting mop involvement inherently limits how interesting a group is to sociopaths
  * Eject sociopaths
    * Geeks can recognize sociopaths but are bad at ejecting them
    * Mops can't recognize sociopaths and wouldn't want to eject them even if they did recognize them
    * Moreover, geeks need sociopaths if the new thing is ever to grow beyond a niche hobby
* Be slightly evil
  * There are still new subcultures, but they don't have the same cultural or social force
  * Fluid mode
  * Be slightly evil - geeks should learn and use some of the sociopaths' tricks
  * Let go of hope that eternalist hope and faith that subculture will provide meaning forever
  * Also resist sociopaths' nihilism - it *is* worthwhile to create new things, even if those things are, in the end, fleeting
