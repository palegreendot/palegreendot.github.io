## Reading Links:
- [Chapters 1 and 2 of _The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind_](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzKwiT2PDjo9QnZYQ0t6TTlfMEE/view)

## Chapter 1: The Consciousness of Consciousness
- Consciousness is "self-evident", but the more closely we look at it, the harder it gets to define
- The extensiveness of consciousness
	- _Reactivity_: responding to stimulus
	- _Consciousness_: more fuzzy term; self-knowledge and introspective knowledge of mental processes and reactions to the world
	- Our brains to all sorts of information processing below the level of consciousness
	- Consciousness cannot even detect the presence of (much less control) many subconscious processes
	- Consciousness is also probably not a continuous process - brains knit over spatial and temporal gaps to present the illusion that we're always conscious
	- Too much consciousness can be detrimental - playing piano is impossible if you consciously think about what your fingers are doing
- Consciousness is not a copy of existence
	- We can recognize facts about the world even when we can't consciously recall them
	- We can only consciously recall what we've consciously stored
	- Conscious recall is not the retrieval of whole images
		- Recall specific details
		- Pattern match to fill in gaps
	- Conscious recall works in narrative form - we recall experiences and then model ourselves to determine what sensations and emotions we would have felt
	- Many people have "third person" memories, even though experiences always take place in the first person
- Consciousness not necessary for concepts
	- Many animals display the ability to generalize even though they don't display signs of consciousness
- Consciousness not necessary for learning
	- Conditioning takes place without any conscious input whatsoever
	- Conscious recognition can hinder conditional learning
	- Even in "conscious" learning, our conscious minds seem to set goals and then let our unconscious figure out how to achieve those goals
- Consciousness not necessary for thinking
	- The process of comparing and rendering judgement is largely carried out by the unconscious
	- Thinking is an automatic process where the conscious mind sets up a "struction" and the unconscious carries it out
	- _struction_: The target or constraint for the unconscious mind's search or association process
- Consciousness not necessary for reason
	- Most of the "work" in reasoning appears to be carried out by the unconscious mind
	- Conscious mind sets up an elaborate struction, lets unconscious mind work on it, results come back as a "flash of insight"
- The Location of Consciousness
	- We have a notion of a specific mind space in which conscious thought takes place, but no such physical space exists
- Is consciousness even necessary?
	- Not needed for the performance of skills
	- Not necessary for learning
	- Not necessary for reasoning
	- No location save an imaginary one
	- So does it even exist? Or is it an illusion?
	- Is it possible to have a group of people who behave exactly the same way that we do, but are not conscious?

## Chapter 2: Consciousness
- Metaphor and language
	- _Metaphor_: The use of a term for one thing to describe another thing
	- Two terms in a metaphor:
		- _Metaphrand_: thing being described
		- _Metaphier_: the thing or relationship being used to describe
	- Metaphors consist of a known metaphier working on an unknown metaphrand
	- Metaphors allow us to bootstrap abstract descriptions by generalizing from concrete phenomena and objects that we observe in the world
- Understanding as metaphor
	- When we seek to understand something, we're trying to find a model that accurately describes that thing
	- That model is a metaphor for the thing it's trying to describe
	- We use _model_ and _theory_ interchangeably, but we should not
		- A model is a particular simplified representation of the world
		- A theory is the mathematical relationship that asserts that the world behaves as the model predicts
		- Theories can be proven correct or incorrect, not models
		- Theories are metaphors where the data is the metaphrand and the model is the metaphier
	- If understanding a phenomenon means coming up with a metaphor for it, we will have trouble understanding consciousness -- difficult to find anything to compare immediate experiences to
	- _Analog_: 
		- Specific kind of model
		- Generated by thing that it's an analog of
		- Descriptive, rather than predictive
		- Example: a map is an analog of a particular piece of territory
- The metaphor language of mind
	- Subjective consciousness is an analog of the real world
	- Build up a vocabulary whose terms are all metaphors or analogs of behavior in the real world
	- We describe the state of mind-space with the same visual and spatial terms we use to describe physical spaces
	- So, we're using reality as a metaphier, but what is the metaphrand?
- Paraphiers and paraphrands
	- _Paraphier_: associations or connotations of the metaphier
	- _Paraphrand_: associations or connotations of the metaphrand
	- In many metaphors, similarities between paraphiers and paraphrands are more important than similarities between metaphiers and metaphrands
	- Consciousness is the metaphrand that is generated by the paraphrands of our verbal expressions
	- We use consciousness as a metaphier to compare the present state of the world to world-states we've encountered in the past
- The features of consciousness:
	1. Spatialization
		- We grant features spatial separation and characteristics, even when they are completely abstract concepts
		- Time, for example, is not spatial, but we treat it as if it was (e.g. timelines, clocks)
	2. Excerption
		- We observe parts and instinctively combine those observations to form a model of the whole
		- When we recall, we don't recall holistically -- rather, we recall excerpts and combine them to generate an abstract model of our experience
	3. The analog 'I'
		- We have a metaphor of ourselves that we can use to explore the consequences of particular actions before we take those actions
	4. The metaphor 'me'
	5. Narratization
		- Our minds take our past experiences and turn them into a narrative
		- We choose future experiences that are congruent with that narrative
		- We narratize everything that we perceive, not just ourselves
	6. Conciliation
		- We edit excerpts and images to make them compatible with one another
		- Example: When asked to imagine a tower and a meadow, one imagines the tower rising from the meadow
- Conclusion
	- Consciousness is a process rather than an object or location
	- Operates by way of analogy
		- Constructs an analog space that reflects the real world
		- Constructs an 'analog I' to explor that space that reflects yourself
	- Excerpts relevant memories and uses them to construct a narrative
	- Conciliates and generates meaning from excerpts
	- *If consciousness is dependent on language, then it must have arisen after language*
